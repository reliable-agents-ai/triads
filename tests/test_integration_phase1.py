## Research Summary

Based on analysis of developer communities and existing tools...

[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: research_finding_1
node_type: Finding
label: High demand for context-aware suggestions
description: Analysis of 500+ developer forum posts shows 73% want AI suggestions that understand project context
confidence: 0.92
evidence: Stack Overflow survey 2024, Reddit r/programming posts
[/GRAPH_UPDATE]

[GRAPH_UPDATE]

label: Privacy concerns with cloud-based tools
description: 45% of enterprise developers express concerns about sending code to cloud services
confidence: 0.88
evidence: GitHub Developer Survey 2024, HackerNews discussions
[/GRAPH_UPDATE]

## Key Findings

- High demand for AI-powered code completion (73% of developers surveyed)
- Strong preference for local/on-device processing in enterprise contexts
- Main pain points: context awareness, language support, performance
- Competitors: GitHub Copilot (market leader), Tabnine, CodeWhisperer

## Open Questions

- What is the ideal latency threshold for real-time suggestions?
- Should we prioritize breadth (many languages) or depth (few languages well)?
- How to balance model size vs. inference speed?

## Recommendations

- Focus on local-first architecture to address privacy concerns
- Start with Python and JavaScript (highest demand)
- Target <100ms latency for inline suggestions
- Consider hybrid approach: local for simple completions, cloud for complex reasoning

## Key Findings

- Latency tolerance: 100-200ms is acceptable threshold
- Language priorities: Python (1st), TypeScript (2nd), Rust (3rd)
- Integration preferences: 68% prefer native editor plugins over standalone tools

## Decisions

- Target latency: <150ms P95 for inline suggestions
- Phase 1 languages: Python, TypeScript
- Phase 2 languages: Rust, Go, Java

## Recommendations

- Build editor-agnostic core engine
- Start with VSCode plugin (largest market share)
- Consider JetBrains second (strong enterprise presence)

## Key Findings
- Latency tolerance: 100-200ms is acceptable threshold

## Decisions Made

- Phase 1 languages: Python, TypeScript
[/AGENT_CONTEXT]

## Architecture Proposal

Based on research and community validation, I propose:

**Core Engine**: Rust-based inference engine for performance
**Model**: Fine-tuned CodeLlama 7B (local execution)
**Interface**: Language Server Protocol (editor-agnostic)

[HITL_REQUIRED]
## APPROVAL REQUIRED: Architecture Decision

The proposed architecture has significant implications:

1. **Technology Stack**: Rust (performance) vs Python (ease)
2. **Model Choice**: CodeLlama 7B (quality) vs smaller model (speed)
3. **Scope**: LSP-based (universal) vs editor-specific (faster time-to-market)

**Recommendation**: Approve Rust + CodeLlama + LSP approach

**Trade-offs**:
- Pros: Best performance, editor-agnostic, scalable
- Cons: Longer development time, requires Rust expertise

**Question**: Do you approve this architecture, or would you like to explore alternatives?
[/HITL_REQUIRED]

## Recommendations

- Proceed to implementation if approved
- If not approved: reconvene with solution-architect for alternative designs
