## What is this?

**Triad Generator** is a meta-AI system that researches your workflow and automatically generates custom teams of AI agents optimized for how *you* work.

Instead of forcing you to adapt to generic templates, it:
1. **Interviews you** about your workflow
2. **Researches your domain** (web search + analysis)
3. **Designs optimal agent teams** (groups of 3 with context-preserving bridges)
4. **Generates everything** (agents, hooks, docs, quality enforcement)

### The Result

You get a custom system of specialist AI agents organized into **triads** (groups of 3) with **bridge agents** that preserve context as work flows through phases—eliminating the #1 problem in multi-agent systems: context loss.

```

                                     ├─ Agent E
                                     └─ Agent F
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (with pip)
- **[Claude Code CLI](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code)** installed
- **Anthropic API key** (optional, for auto-router LLM disambiguation)
- Any git repository

### Dependencies

The system automatically installs these Python dependencies:

**Core Requirements**:
- `networkx` - Knowledge graph management
- `sentence-transformers` - Semantic routing embeddings (v0.2.0+)
- `torch` - Deep learning backend for sentence-transformers (v0.2.0+)
- `numpy` - Numerical operations (v0.2.0+)
- `anthropic` - Claude API client for LLM disambiguation (v0.2.0+)

**Auto-Router Note**: The semantic model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) will auto-download on first use (~100MB). Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for LLM fallback routing, though the router works without it via manual selection.

### Installation

**Quick Install (Recommended):**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reliable-agents-ai/triads/main/quick-install.sh | bash
```

**Or download and install manually:**
```bash
# Download latest release
curl -LO https://github.com/reliable-agents-ai/triads/releases/latest/download/triad-generator-latest.tar.gz
tar -xzf triad-generator-latest.tar.gz
cd triad-generator-*
./install-triads.sh
```

**Or clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reliable-agents-ai/triads.git
cd triads
./install-triads.sh
```

### First Use

```bash
# Launch Claude Code in your project
claude code

# Run the generator
> /generate-triads

# Answer questions about your workflow
# Get a custom triad system designed for you!

# Then just start working naturally - the auto-router handles the rest
> I have an idea for improving the login flow
→ Auto-routes to Idea Validation triad (v0.2.0+)
```

**That's it!** The system will interview you, research your domain, and generate a complete multi-agent workflow with intelligent auto-routing.

## Key Features

### 🔄 Multi-Instance Workflow Management (v0.7.0+)

**Track multiple concurrent workflows per project** - work on multiple features simultaneously without confusion:
- **Workflow Index**: See all active workflows at session start
- **Instance Management**: Each workflow tracked separately with unique instance IDs
- **Slash Commands**: `/workflows list` and `/workflows resume <id>` for easy navigation
- **Auto-Create**: New workflow instances created automatically when starting triads
- **Progress Tracking**: Bridge agents track triad completion across instances
- **Concurrent-Safe**: Atomic file operations prevent race conditions

### 🤖 Intelligent Auto-Router (v0.2.0+)

**No more manual triad commands** - just describe what you want:
- 4-stage graceful degradation: Grace period → Semantic → LLM → Manual
- Semantic routing: 15-20ms with >65% hit rate
- LLM disambiguation: Context-aware Claude API fallback
- Training mode: Learn routing behavior with confirmations
- CLI control: `/router-status`, `/switch-triad`, `/router-reset`

### 🧠 Self-Discovering (No Templates)

Unlike systems with rigid templates, Triad Generator:
- Researches YOUR specific workflow through conversation
- Web searches industry best practices for YOUR domain
- Designs triads optimized for YOUR phases
- Places bridge agents at YOUR context loss points

### 🌉 Context Preservation (Bridge Agents)

**Bridge agents** participate in 2 triads simultaneously:
- Compress knowledge graphs intelligently (top 20 nodes)
- Carry forward decisions, uncertainties, and findings
- **Result**: Zero context loss, ~40% faster than hierarchical patterns

### ⚖️ Constitutional Quality (TRUST Principles)

Every agent follows the **TRUST framework** - 5 immutable principles:

| Principle | TRUST | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 1. **T**horough over fast | **T** | Verify thoroughly, never shortcut |
| 2. **R**equire evidence | **R** | Triple-verify, cite sources |
| 3. **U**ncertainty escalation | **U** | Never guess when unsure |
| 4. **S**how all work | **S** | Complete transparency in reasoning |
| 5. **T**est assumptions | **T** | Question and validate everything |

Python hooks enforce TRUST architecturally (not just prompts).

### 📊 Knowledge Graphs (NetworkX) with Corruption Prevention (v0.9.0)

Each triad builds a local graph as it works:
- Captures entities, decisions, uncertainties
- File-based (JSON), human-readable
- No external services required
- Persists learning across sessions
- **6-layer corruption prevention system** ensures data integrity:
  - Atomic writes with file locking (prevents concurrent corruption)
  - Schema validation (94% coverage, blocks invalid data)
  - Agent output validation (validates `[GRAPH_UPDATE]` blocks)
  - Automatic backup/recovery (backup before every write)
  - Integrity checker CLI (`triads-km check`, `triads-km repair`)
  - 103 comprehensive tests (100% passing)
- **Production-ready reliability** - zero known corruption scenarios

### 🎯 Claude Code Native

Built specifically for Claude Code:
- Slash command integration (`/generate-triads`)
- Sub-agent architecture
- Lifecycle hooks (pre/post execution)
- Session-aware context management

## How It Works

### The Generator Triad (Meta-Level)

Three meta-agents design your system:

```
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Domain Researcher   │  Interviews you + researches domain
└──────────┬───────────┘
           │ Discovers workflow phases and needs
           ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Workflow Analyst    │  Designs optimal triad structure
└──────────┬───────────┘
           │ Creates agent specifications
           ▼
┌──────────────────────┐
│  Triad Architect     │  Generates all files
└──────────────────────┘
```

### Your Custom Triads (Generated)

After generation, you'll have 3-5 triads tailored to your workflow:

**Example: Software Development**
```
Discovery Triad
├─ Codebase Analyst (explores code)
├─ Requirements Gatherer (documents needs)
└─ Knowledge Synthesizer [BRIDGE] (integrates findings)

Design Triad
├─ Knowledge Synthesizer [BRIDGE] (carries context)
├─ Solution Architect [BRIDGE] (designs approach)
└─ Security Analyst (reviews for vulnerabilities)

Implementation Triad
├─ Solution Architect [BRIDGE] (carries design)
├─ Senior Developer (implements)
└─ Code Reviewer (validates quality)
```

**Example: RFP/Bid Writing**
```
Analysis Triad → Strategy Triad → Writing Triad → Validation Triad
(with bridges preserving requirements and win themes throughout)
```

### Usage Flow

```bash
# Start with first triad
> Start Discovery: analyze the authentication system

[Discovery triad runs, builds knowledge graph]

# Continue to next phase
> Start Design: plan OAuth2 integration

[Knowledge Synthesizer bridges context forward automatically]
[Design triad works with full requirements - no context loss!]

# Implement
> Start Implementation: build OAuth2 flow

[Solution Architect bridges design decisions forward]
[Implementation proceeds with complete context]
```

## Auto-Router

**New in v0.2.0**: The auto-router automatically detects your intent and routes to the appropriate triad without manual `Start {Triad}:` commands.

### How It Works

The router uses a **4-stage graceful degradation pipeline** that balances speed, accuracy, and user control:

```
User Prompt
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 1: Grace Period Check             │
│ • 5 turns OR 8 minutes                  │
│ • Prevents mid-conversation disruption  │
│ • Bypassed by explicit /switch-triad    │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │ Grace period expired?
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 2: Semantic Routing (15-20ms)     │
│ • Sentence-transformers embeddings      │
│ • Confidence threshold: 70%             │
│ • Ambiguity detection: <10% gap         │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │ Confident & unambiguous?
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 3: LLM Disambiguation (<2s)       │
│ • Claude 3.5 Sonnet API                 │
│ • Context-aware reasoning               │
│ • Exponential backoff retry             │
└─────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
              │ LLM available & responsive?
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Stage 4: Manual Selection (always works)│
│ • Interactive prompt with options       │
│ • Shows confidence scores               │
│ • User chooses or cancels               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Performance**:
- **Semantic routing**: 15-20ms P95 latency
- **LLM disambiguation**: <2s with timeout
- **Semantic hit rate**: >65% in production testing
- **Grace period**: 0ms (routing bypassed)

### Usage Examples

**Natural conversation** (router detects intent automatically):

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude code

# Just describe what you want - no manual triad commands needed
> I have an idea for a new feature that could improve user engagement
→ Auto-routes to Idea Validation triad (confidence: 89%)

> Let's design the authentication system with OAuth2
→ Auto-routes to Design triad (confidence: 94%)

> Can you implement the login flow we just designed?
→ Auto-routes to Implementation triad (confidence: 91%)

> This code needs refactoring - too much duplication
→ Auto-routes to Garden Tending triad (confidence: 87%)
```

**Manual override** (when you want explicit control):

```bash
# Explicitly switch triads (bypasses grace period)
> /switch-triad implementation

# Check current routing state
> /router-status
Current triad: implementation
Turn count: 3/5 (grace period active)
Grace period: 6 minutes remaining
Training mode: off

# Force a re-route
> /router-reset
```

### Configuration

Router behavior is controlled by `.claude/router/config.json`:

```json
{
  "confidence_threshold": 0.70,           // Minimum confidence for semantic routing
  "semantic_similarity_threshold": 0.10,  // Max gap for ambiguity detection
  "grace_period_turns": 5,                // Grace period: turns before re-routing
  "grace_period_minutes": 8,              // Grace period: time limit before re-routing
  "llm_timeout_ms": 2000,                 // LLM disambiguation timeout
  "training_mode": false,                 // Show confirmation prompts for learning
  "telemetry_enabled": true,              // Log routing decisions for analytics
  "model_path": "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
}
```

**Environment variable overrides**:

```bash
# Override configuration at runtime
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_CONFIDENCE=0.75       # Stricter semantic threshold
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_GRACE_TURNS=10        # Longer grace period
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_GRACE_MINUTES=15      # Extended time window
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_LLM_TIMEOUT=3000      # More time for LLM
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_TRAINING=true         # Enable training mode
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_TELEMETRY=false       // Disable telemetry
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...        # Required for LLM disambiguation
```

### CLI Commands

Control and debug the router with built-in commands:

**`/router-status`** - View current routing state

```bash
> /router-status

Router Status:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Active triad:     implementation
Turn count:       3/5
Last activity:    2 minutes ago
Grace period:     ACTIVE (2 turns or 6 minutes remaining)
Training mode:    off
Telemetry:        enabled
```

**`/switch-triad [name]`** - Manually switch triads

```bash
> /switch-triad design

✓ Switched to Design triad
  Grace period reset
```

**`/router-reset`** - Clear routing state

```bash
> /router-reset

✓ Router state cleared
  Turn count: 0
  Grace period: inactive
  Ready for fresh routing
```

**`/router-training [on|off]`** - Toggle training mode

```bash
> /router-training on

✓ Training mode enabled
  Router will now ask for confirmation before switching triads

> I want to validate this idea

🤔 Router suggests: Idea Validation
   Confidence: 92%
   Reasoning: High semantic match with idea validation keywords

   Confirm switch? [y/n]: y

✓ Switched to Idea Validation triad
```

**`/router-stats`** - View routing performance metrics

```bash
> /router-stats

Routing Statistics (last 100 routes):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Semantic routing:      68% (avg 18ms)
LLM disambiguation:    24% (avg 1.2s)
Manual selection:       8% (user choice)
Grace period bypass:   45% (stayed in current triad)

Most routed triads:
1. Implementation      32%
2. Design             28%
3. Idea Validation    22%
4. Garden Tending     12%
5. Deployment          6%
```

### Training Mode

For new users or to understand routing behavior:

```bash
# Enable training mode
> /router-training on

# Router will now show its reasoning and ask for confirmation
> I need to research if this feature idea is worth building

🤔 Router Analysis:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Method:      Semantic routing
Top match:   Idea Validation (confidence: 89%)
Runner-up:   Design (confidence: 58%)
Gap:         31% (unambiguous)

Reasoning:   Keywords "research", "feature idea", "worth building"
             strongly match Idea Validation triad patterns

Grace period: Not active (this is your first prompt)

Confirm switch to Idea Validation? [y/n]: y

✓ Switched to Idea Validation triad

[After 50 confirmed suggestions, training mode auto-graduates to full automation]
```

Training mode features:
- Shows routing method (semantic vs LLM vs manual)
- Displays confidence scores and reasoning
- Explains grace period status
- Lets you override suggestions
- Auto-graduates after 50 confirmations

### Troubleshooting

**Router not activating**:

```bash
# Check if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set (required for LLM fallback)
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Verify router configuration exists
cat ~/.claude/router/config.json

# Enable training mode to see what's happening
/router-training on
```

**Incorrect routing**:

```bash
# Check recent routing decisions
tail -n 20 ~/.claude/router/logs/routing_telemetry.jsonl

# Review which method was used
# If semantic routing is wrong, LLM should catch it
# If LLM is also wrong, use manual override:
/switch-triad [correct-triad-name]

# Report patterns to improve routing:
# - Low semantic confidence but correct LLM routing → good
# - High semantic confidence but wrong → check route definitions
# - LLM wrong → check triad descriptions in config
```

**Performance issues**:

```bash
# Semantic model should auto-download on first use
# Check if cached:
ls ~/.cache/torch/sentence_transformers/

# If missing or slow, download manually:
python3 -c "from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer; \
           SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')"

# Reduce LLM timeout if Claude API is slow:
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_LLM_TIMEOUT=1500  # 1.5s instead of 2s

# Disable telemetry for slight speedup (1-2ms):
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_TELEMETRY=false
```

**Mid-conversation re-routing (disruptive)**:

```bash
# This should be prevented by grace period (5 turns OR 8 minutes)
# If happening, increase grace period:
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_GRACE_TURNS=10
export CLAUDE_ROUTER_GRACE_MINUTES=15

# Or use explicit commands when ready to switch:
/switch-triad [next-triad-name]

# Check grace period status:
/router-status
```

**LLM disambiguation failing**:

```bash
# LLM requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api01-...

# Check API key is valid:
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" \
  -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"test"}]}'

# If API key missing/invalid, router falls back to manual selection
# This always works, even without internet
```

### Architecture Notes

The auto-router is designed with **graceful degradation**:

1. **Fast path** (semantic): 15-20ms, handles 65%+ of cases
2. **Smart fallback** (LLM): <2s, handles ambiguous cases
3. **Always works** (manual): No dependencies, user has final control

**Why this approach?**
- **Semantic routing** is fast but can be ambiguous
- **LLM** provides reasoning but requires API and time
- **Manual selection** ensures the system never blocks the user
- **Grace period** prevents disruptive mid-conversation switches

This creates a system that is:
- Fast (most requests <20ms)
- Smart (LLM helps with edge cases)
- Reliable (always has a fallback)
- Controllable (user can override at any time)

## Knowledge Management CLI

**New in v0.9.0**: Command-line tools for knowledge graph integrity checking and recovery.

### Integrity Checking

Validate knowledge graph integrity to detect corruption:

```bash
# Check specific graph
triads-km check deployment_graph

# Check all graphs
triads-km check-all

# Verbose output showing all checks
triads-km check deployment_graph --verbose
```

**Checks performed**:
- Schema compliance (required keys, valid types)
- Referential integrity (edges point to valid nodes)
- Confidence score validity (0.0-1.0 range)
- Required field presence (id, label, type)
- JSON structural integrity

**Output**:
```
Knowledge Graph Integrity Check
Graph: deployment_graph.json
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✓ Schema compliance
✓ Referential integrity (28 edges validated)
✓ Confidence scores (12 nodes checked)
✓ Required fields present
✓ JSON structure valid

Result: PASSED (0 issues found)
```

### Backup Management

View available backups for recovery:

```bash
# List backups for specific graph
triads-km list-backups deployment_graph

# Shows timestamped backups with file sizes
Backups for deployment_graph:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
deployment_graph_20251023_143022.json  (24.5 KB)
deployment_graph_20251023_121045.json  (23.8 KB)
deployment_graph_20251023_095533.json  (22.1 KB)
...
```

### Recovery

Restore corrupted graph from backup:

```bash
# Restore from most recent backup
triads-km restore deployment_graph

# Restore from specific backup
triads-km restore deployment_graph --backup 20251023_143022

# List backups to find timestamp
triads-km list-backups deployment_graph
```

**Recovery process**:
1. Validates backup file exists and is valid JSON
2. Checks backup passes integrity checks
3. Creates safety backup of current (corrupted) file
4. Replaces current file with backup
5. Verifies restored graph passes all checks

### Repair

Attempt automatic repair of corrupted graph:

```bash
# Repair structural issues
triads-km repair deployment_graph
```

**Repair capabilities**:
- Removes edges pointing to non-existent nodes
- Removes duplicate nodes (keeps first occurrence)
- Fixes invalid confidence scores (clamps to 0.0-1.0)
- Adds missing required fields with defaults
- Validates JSON structure

**Note**: Repair is best-effort. For severe corruption, use `restore` instead.

### Use Cases

**Pre-deployment validation**:
```bash
# Add to CI/CD pipeline
triads-km check-all
# Exit code 0 = all graphs valid
# Exit code 1 = corruption detected
```

**Regular maintenance**:
```bash
# Cron job for daily integrity checks
0 2 * * * cd /path/to/project && triads-km check-all >> logs/integrity.log 2>&1
```

**Recovery from corruption**:
```bash
# If graph corruption detected
triads-km check deployment_graph  # Identify issues
triads-km list-backups deployment_graph  # Find good backup
triads-km restore deployment_graph --backup <timestamp>  # Restore
triads-km check deployment_graph  # Verify fixed
```

**Performance**:
- Integrity check: <1s for 1000-node graph
- Backup listing: <100ms
- Restore operation: <500ms
- Repair operation: <1s for large graphs

## Theoretical Foundations

Triad Generator is built on solid academic research:

### Triad Theory (Simmel, 1908)

Georg Simmel's sociological research identified that **groups of 3 are optimal**:
- **Mediation potential**: Third member can resolve conflicts
- **Efficiency**: Only 3 communication channels (vs 28 in 8-person group)
- **Accountability**: Everyone's contribution is visible
- **Proven pattern**: Used in sports teams, military units, business leadership

### Overlapping Triads (2025 Research)

Recent organizational research shows overlapping triads with shared members:
- **Prevent information silos**: Bridges naturally transfer knowledge
- **40% faster than hierarchical** (no central bottleneck)
- **Graceful scaling**: Add triads without redesigning system
- **Natural workflow alignment**: Matches how humans actually work in phases

### TRUST Framework (Constitutional AI)

Based on research from [reliableagents.ai](https://reliableagents.ai), the **TRUST framework** provides:
- **Architectural enforcement**: Principles embedded in system structure, not just prompts
- **Instruction hierarchy**: TRUST rules override all other instructions
- **Behavioral DNA**: Immutable characteristics that can't be changed by circumstances
- **Quality assurance framework**: Multi-stage verification with mandatory protocols

The TRUST acronym makes these principles memorable and actionable for agents.

### Autonomous Knowledge Graphs

Self-organizing knowledge networks that:
- **Discover schema** without predefined ontologies (95% semantic alignment)
- **Evolve structure** based on what agents learn
- **Preserve provenance**: Every fact cites its source
- **Support reasoning**: Graph traversal for context and dependencies

---

## Examples

### Software Development

**You**: "I build software features. Requirements → Design → Code → Test"

**System generates**:
- Discovery Triad (analyzes codebase + requirements)
- Design Triad (plans solution + security)
- Implementation Triad (codes + reviews)
- Bridge agents preserve requirements and design decisions

**Result**: No lost requirements between phases, security considered throughout

### RFP Response Writing

**You**: "I write proposals. Analyze RFP → Research → Strategy → Write → Validate"

**System generates**:
- Analysis Triad (extracts requirements + compliance)
- Strategy Triad (develops win themes)
- Writing Triad (drafts sections)
- Validation Triad (compliance check + pricing)
- Bridges preserve requirements matrix and win themes

**Result**: Compliance requirements tracked end-to-end, win themes consistent

### Lead Generation

**You**: "I source leads. Find prospects → Qualify → Enrich → Prepare outreach"

**System generates**:
- Prospecting Triad (searches + qualifies)
- Enrichment Triad (builds profiles)
- Outreach Prep Triad (personalizes messaging)
- Bridges preserve qualification criteria and insights

**Result**: Personalization based on complete prospect context

## Security

### Critical Fixes in v0.7.0-alpha.7

**Path Traversal Vulnerability** (CVE-eligible severity):
- **Issue**: Workflow instance IDs were not validated, allowing potential arbitrary file access
- **Fixed**: Comprehensive input validation in `src/triads/utils/workflow_context.py`
- **Impact**: Prevents malicious instance IDs like `../../../etc/passwd` from accessing system files

**Race Condition in Concurrent Workflows**:
- **Issue**: Concurrent file access could corrupt workflow state
- **Fixed**: Atomic file operations with locking in workflow instance management
- **Impact**: 100% stability under concurrent access (tested with 5 concurrent threads)

**Recommendation**: Upgrade to v0.7.0-alpha.7 or later for production use. These security fixes are critical for multi-user environments and concurrent workflow operations.

./install.sh --force          # Skip safety checks
```

### Safe Uninstallation

The uninstaller removes only generator components, preserving your work:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

**Preserves**:
- Your custom agents (`.claude/agents/`)
- Your knowledge graphs (`.claude/graphs/`)
- Your configuration (`.claude/settings.json`)

**Removes**:
- Generator meta-agents
- Template library
- Slash command

**Creates backup** before any removal.

### Upgrading

```bash
./upgrade.sh
```

Upgrades generator components while preserving customizations.
