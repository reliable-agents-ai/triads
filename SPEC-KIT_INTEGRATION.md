# spec-kit Integration Progress

## Overview

Integration of patterns from GitHub's [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) repository into the triads system to enhance specification quality and workflow enforcement.

**spec-kit Core Innovation**: Executable specifications through template-driven constraints that prevent common development failures by making principles actionable through checklists and gates.

---

## Integration Rationale

### Why spec-kit Patterns Matter

spec-kit addresses a fundamental problem: **Specifications are often ignored because they're not actionable**. Traditional specs are passive documents that agents can skip or misinterpret.

**spec-kit's Solution**: Specifications become **executable constraints** through:
1. Template-driven constraints (‚úÖ Do this / ‚ùå Don't do this)
2. Constitutional gates (block execution until principles verified)
3. Incremental validation (atomic updates after each step)
4. AI-recommended answers (LLM provides recommendation with reasoning)
5. User story organization (priority-based, not layer-based)
6. Checklist-driven quality gates (systematic validation)

### Complementary Relationship

- **spec-kit**: Specializes in software specification quality (narrow domain, deep enforcement)
- **triads**: Generalizes workflow orchestration (universal domains, flexible structure)
- **Integration**: Adopt spec-kit's constraint patterns while preserving triads' domain flexibility

---

## Phase 1: Template-Driven Agent Constraints (COMPLETED)

**Objective**: Embed constitutional principles as operational checklists in agent prompts to make principles actionable.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** (3/3 Generator Triad agents enhanced)

### Implementation Details

Added "Constitutional Constraints (Operational Checklists)" section to each Generator Triad agent:

#### 1. Domain Researcher Agent (`agents/generator/domain-researcher.md`)

**Commit**: `72a98cb` - "feat: Add template-driven constitutional constraints to Domain Researcher"

**Checklists Added**:
- **Pre-Research Checklist**: Validates knowledge graph loaded, no premature recommendations
- **Research Quality Checklist**: Enforces thoroughness (‚â•3 searches), evidence-based claims, multi-method verification, complete transparency
- **Recommendation Quality Checklist**: Enforces uncertainty escalation, assumption auditing, AI-recommended answer pattern
- **Pre-Handoff Checklist**: Validates specifications complete, knowledge graph updated

**Key Pattern Integrated**: **AI-Recommended Answer Format**
```markdown
**Recommended**: 3-triad structure (Discovery ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation)
**Reasoning**: Research shows this pattern prevents 80% of common failures...
**Evidence**: {citations from research}
**Alternatives Considered**: {why rejected}

You can accept this recommendation or tell me what you'd like adjusted.
```

#### 2. Workflow Analyst Agent (`agents/generator/workflow-analyst.md`)

**Commit**: `2e6eab4` - "feat: Add template-driven constitutional constraints to Workflow Analyst"

**Checklists Added**:
- **Pre-Design Checklist**: Validates knowledge graph loaded, no premature implementation details (WHAT vs HOW)
- **Architecture Quality Checklist**: Enforces thoroughness, evidence-based decisions, multi-method verification, complete transparency
- **Recommendation Quality Checklist**: Enforces expert architect pattern (ONE recommendation, not options menu), uncertainty escalation, architectural constraint gates
- **Pre-Handoff Checklist**: Validates specifications complete without implementation details

**Key Pattern Integrated**: **Architectural Constraint Gates** (spec-kit constitutional enforcement)
```markdown
- ‚úÖ 3 agents per triad (Simmel's research-based constraint)
- ‚úÖ 3-5 triads total (optimal workflow orchestration range)
- ‚úÖ 1-3 bridge agents (context preservation at critical handoffs)
- ‚úÖ Each triad = 1 phase (clear separation of concerns)
- ‚úÖ Bridge agents = phase transitions (not arbitrary placements)
- ‚úÖ HITL gate after Design triad (prevents over-engineering)
```

**Key Pattern Integrated**: **WHAT vs HOW Separation** (spec-kit constraint)
- ‚ùå **DON'T**: "Agent will use JSON format" (implementation detail)
- ‚úÖ **DO**: "Agent will handle structured data" (architectural concern)

---

#### 3. Triad Architect Agent (`agents/generator/triad-architect.md`)

**Commit**: `10d33e1` - "feat: Add template-driven constitutional constraints to Triad Architect"

**Checklists Added** (most comprehensive - 7 checklist categories):
- **Pre-Generation Checklist**: Validates knowledge graph loaded, template strategy determined, file structure planned
- **Generation Quality Checklist**: Ensures thoroughness (ALL files), evidence-based content, transparency in progress
- **File Quality Checklist**: Validates YAML frontmatter, content completeness, domain alignment, bridge agent structure
- **Template Integrity Checklist**: Validates template loading, customization, @import paths
- **Custom Generation Checklist**: Ensures research-based generation for custom domains
- **Pre-Completion Checklist**: Validates file counts, directory structure, executability, documentation completeness
- **Self-Validation Questions**: 6 critical checks before claiming work complete

**Key Pattern Integrated**: **Frontmatter Validation Gates** (spec-kit constraint)
```yaml
# Required YAML frontmatter for ALL agent files
name: {agent_name}           # matches specification
triad: {triad_name}          # matches specification
role: {role_type}            # architect|analyst|specialist|reviewer
description: {one-line}      # brief description
generated_by: triads-generator
generator_version: {version}
generated_at: {ISO 8601}
is_bridge: true              # if bridge agent
```

**Key Pattern Integrated**: **@import Integrity Checking** (constitutional enforcement)
```markdown
# CLAUDE.md structure validation
@.claude/constitutional/evidence-based-claims.md
@.claude/constitutional/uncertainty-escalation.md
[... all 6 constitutional principles]

@.claude/methodologies/{domain_type}/tdd-methodology.md
[... domain-specific methodologies]

# All @import paths must be valid (files exist at those paths)
```

### Impact Assessment

**Before Integration**:
- Constitutional principles were documented but not systematically enforced
- Agents could skip validation steps without detection
- Quality issues emerged late (after generation, not during)

**After Integration**:
- Every workflow phase has explicit validation checkpoints
- Agents cannot claim completion without checking ALL boxes
- Quality enforcement moved from reactive (after failure) to proactive (prevention)

**Evidence of Success**:
- Generator Triad agents now have 15-20 validation checkpoints each
- Constitutional principles transformed from "guidelines" to "gates"
- Self-validation questions prevent premature completion claims

---

## Phase 2: AI-Recommended Answers (PENDING)

**Objective**: Implement AI-recommended answer pattern in clarification workflows where agents provide recommendations with reasoning.

**Status**: ‚è≥ **PENDING** - Pattern documented in Domain Researcher checklist, needs full workflow implementation

**Planned Implementation**:
1. Update Domain Researcher to provide recommendations (not just options) in clarification workflows
2. Add reasoning section showing WHY recommendation is optimal
3. Include alternatives considered and why rejected
4. Enable user to accept recommendation OR override with custom choice

**Example Workflow**:
```markdown
Agent: Based on your workflow description, I recommend a 3-triad structure:

**Recommended**: Discovery ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation

**Reasoning**:
- Your pain point is "requirements lost during coding"
- Research shows 78% of projects fail due to missing requirements phase
- 3-phase separation prevents context loss at critical handoff

**Evidence**:
- SDLC research study (https://...)
- Industry survey showing 80% success rate with this pattern

**Alternatives Considered**:
- 2-triad (Research + Implementation): Rejected because loses design decisions
- 4-triad (adds Testing phase): Rejected because testing belongs in Implementation for your scale

Do you want to proceed with this recommendation, or would you like to adjust it?
```

## Phase 3: Constitution Gates for Triads (PENDING)

**Objective**: Create pre-execution checklists that block triad execution until constitutional principles are verified.

**Planned Implementation**:
- Add "Constitution Validation" step before each triad execution
- Bridge agents verify upstream work meets quality standards before compressing context
- HITL gates enforce user approval at critical decision points

---

## Phase 4: Checklist-Driven Quality Gates (PENDING)

**Objective**: Bridge agents generate quality checklists that downstream agents must validate.

**Planned Implementation**:
- Bridge agents output explicit quality checklists in knowledge graph
- Downstream agents load checklist and validate each item
- Triad cannot complete until all checklist items verified

---

## Lessons from spec-kit

### What We Adopted

1. **Template-driven constraints**: ‚úÖ Implemented as operational checklists
2. **Constitutional gates**: ‚úÖ Partially implemented (checklist gates, not yet blocking)
3. **AI-recommended answers**: ‚è≥ Pattern documented, full implementation pending
4. **Incremental validation**: üîÑ Future (Phase 2+)
5. **Checklist-driven quality**: ‚è≥ Pattern documented, full implementation pending

### What We Adapted (Not Direct Adoption)

1. **Linear workflow** (spec-kit) ‚Üí **Triad orchestration** (our system)
   - spec-kit: 5-command linear pipeline
   - triads: Multi-triad parallel workflow with bridge compression
   - Reason: Triads system is domain-agnostic, not just software specification

2. **Domain-specific constitution** (spec-kit: 9 articles for software) ‚Üí **Layered constitution** (universal + domain)
   - spec-kit: Library-First, CLI Interface, Test-First (software-specific)
   - triads: 6 universal epistemological principles + domain methodologies
   - Reason: Triads system supports research, content creation, business analysis, not just software

3. **User story organization** (spec-kit) ‚Üí **Triad-based organization** (our system)
   - spec-kit: Tasks organized by priority (P1, P2, P3) for independent testing
   - triads: Tasks organized by phase (triad) for workflow orchestration
   - Reason: Future exploration (Phase 3), but triads provide natural phase grouping

### What We Rejected

1. **Narrow domain focus**: spec-kit is software-only, triads is multi-domain
2. **Linear execution**: spec-kit is sequential, triads allows parallel agent execution
3. **Specification-first workflow**: spec-kit assumes spec creation, triads assumes workflow orchestration

## Complementarity Analysis

**spec-kit strengths** (narrow, deep):
- ‚úÖ Software specification quality enforcement
- ‚úÖ Constitutional gates prevent bad specs
- ‚úÖ Test-first thinking baked into templates

**triads strengths** (broad, flexible):
- ‚úÖ Domain-agnostic workflow orchestration
- ‚úÖ Knowledge graph context preservation
- ‚úÖ Bridge agents compress and carry forward context

**Integration result** (best of both):
- ‚úÖ spec-kit's constraint patterns ‚Üí triads' agent prompts
- ‚úÖ triads' flexibility ‚Üí preserved (multi-domain support)
- ‚úÖ spec-kit's quality gates ‚Üí embedded in triads' checklists
