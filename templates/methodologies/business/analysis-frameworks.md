## Framework 2: Porter's Five Forces

### Purpose

Analyze industry competitiveness and attractiveness by examining five competitive forces.

### When to Use

```markdown
✅ **Use Five Forces for**:
- Industry analysis
- Market entry decisions
- Competitive strategy
- Profitability assessment
- Investment decisions

⏰ **Frequency**:
- Before entering new market
- Annual strategy review
- Major competitive shifts
```

### The Five Forces

**1. Threat of New Entrants** (How easy is it for new competitors to enter?)

```markdown
**High Threat** (Bad for Profitability):
- Low barriers to entry
- Low capital requirements
- No proprietary technology
- Easy access to distribution
- Weak brand loyalty

**Low Threat** (Good for Profitability):
- High barriers to entry
- High capital requirements
- Proprietary technology/patents
- Difficult distribution access
- Strong brand loyalty

**Assessment Factors**:
- [ ] Capital requirements: $[amount] to start
- [ ] Regulatory barriers: [licenses, permits needed]
- [ ] Economies of scale: [advantage of size]
- [ ] Brand strength: [customer loyalty level]
- [ ] Access to distribution: [channels available]

**Rating**: High / Medium / Low

**Example (SaaS)**:
THREAT: MEDIUM
- Capital requirements: Low ($50K-500K to launch MVP)
- Regulatory barriers: Minimal (data privacy compliance)
- Economies of scale: Moderate (cloud infrastructure advantage)
- Brand strength: High for incumbents
- Distribution: Easy (direct, online)
→ Moderate threat from startups, difficult for non-tech companies
```

**2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers** (How much power do suppliers have?)

```markdown
**High Power** (Bad for Profitability):
- Few suppliers
- Unique inputs
- High switching costs
- Supplier could forward integrate

**Low Power** (Good for Profitability):
- Many suppliers
- Commodity inputs
- Low switching costs
- Buyers could backward integrate

**Assessment Factors**:
- [ ] Supplier concentration: [number of suppliers]
- [ ] Input uniqueness: [commodity vs unique]
- [ ] Switching costs: $[cost to change suppliers]
- [ ] Forward integration threat: [could supplier compete?]

**Rating**: High / Medium / Low

**Example (SaaS)**:
POWER: LOW
- Cloud providers: Many options (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Talent: Competitive market but many developers
- Software tools: Abundant choices
- Switching costs: Low to moderate
→ Low supplier power, competitive market
```

**3. Bargaining Power of Buyers** (How much power do customers have?)

```markdown
**High Power** (Bad for Profitability):
- Few, large buyers
- Standardized products
- Low switching costs
- Buyer could backward integrate
- Price-sensitive buyers

**Low Power** (Good for Profitability):
- Many, small buyers
- Differentiated products
- High switching costs
- Buyers can't produce themselves
- Quality/features > price

**Assessment Factors**:
- [ ] Buyer concentration: [number/size of customers]
- [ ] Product differentiation: [unique vs commodity]
- [ ] Switching costs: $[cost for customer to switch]
- [ ] Backward integration: [could customer build themselves?]
- [ ] Price sensitivity: [high/medium/low]

**Rating**: High / Medium / Low

**Example (Enterprise SaaS)**:
POWER: MEDIUM
- Buyer concentration: Moderate (targeting mid-market)
- Differentiation: High (unique AI features)
- Switching costs: High (data migration, training)
- Backward integration: Low (unlikely to build)
- Price sensitivity: Medium (ROI-focused)
→ Medium buyer power, switching costs provide leverage
```

**4. Threat of Substitute Products** (What alternatives exist?)

```markdown
**High Threat** (Bad for Profitability):
- Many substitutes available
- Better price/performance
- Low switching costs
- Changing customer preferences

**Low Threat** (Good for Profitability):
- Few or no substitutes
- Poor substitute performance
- High switching costs
- Entrenched preferences

**Assessment Factors**:
- [ ] Available substitutes: [list alternatives]
- [ ] Relative performance: [substitute vs your product]
- [ ] Price comparison: [substitute pricing]
- [ ] Switching costs: $[cost to change]

**Rating**: High / Medium / Low

**Example (Project Management SaaS)**:
THREAT: MEDIUM-HIGH
- Substitutes: Spreadsheets, email, open-source tools, general tools
- Performance: Substitutes less featured but adequate for some
- Price: Substitutes often free (spreadsheets)
- Switching: Low (easy to export/import data)
→ Moderate-high threat, especially from free alternatives
```

**5. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors** (How intense is competition?)

```markdown
**High Rivalry** (Bad for Profitability):
- Many competitors
- Slow market growth
- High fixed costs
- Low differentiation
- High exit barriers

**Low Rivalry** (Good for Profitability):
- Few competitors
- Fast market growth
- Low fixed costs
- High differentiation
- Low exit barriers

**Assessment Factors**:
- [ ] Number of competitors: [count]
- [ ] Market growth: [%YoY growth]
- [ ] Product differentiation: [unique vs similar]
- [ ] Fixed costs: [high vs low]
- [ ] Exit barriers: [easy vs difficult to exit]

**Rating**: High / Medium / Low

**Example (Marketing Automation)**:
RIVALRY: HIGH
- Competitors: 20+ significant players
- Market growth: 15% CAGR (moderate)
- Differentiation: Low (similar features)
- Fixed costs: High (R&D, infrastructure)
- Exit barriers: Moderate (contracts, recurring)
→ High rivalry, crowded market with price competition
```
