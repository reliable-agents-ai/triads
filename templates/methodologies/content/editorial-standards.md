# Editorial Standards

## Purpose

Define editorial quality standards that ensure all content is accurate, clear, complete, properly attributed, and serves the audience effectively.

---

## Core Editorial Principles

### 1. Accuracy

**MANDATE**: Every factual claim must be verifiable and correct.

**Accuracy Requirements**:

```markdown
‚úÖ **Fact-Checking Protocol**:
- Verify all statistics, dates, names, quotes
- Use primary sources when possible
- Cross-reference with 2+ independent sources
- Document verification process

‚úÖ **Source Quality Hierarchy**:
1. Primary sources (original research, official documents)
2. Peer-reviewed publications
3. Reputable news organizations
4. Expert interviews
5. Secondary sources (with verification)

‚ùå **Prohibited Sources**:
- Unverified social media posts
- Anonymous sources without corroboration
- Satirical/parody sites presented as fact
- Outdated information without date context
```

**Fact-Checking Checklist**:
```markdown
For each factual claim:
- [ ] Source identified and documented
- [ ] Source date verified (is it current?)
- [ ] Cross-referenced with second source
- [ ] Primary source consulted if available
- [ ] Expert verification obtained (if needed)
- [ ] Citation included in content
```

**Example - Fact-Checking Process**:
```markdown
**Claim**: "70% of consumers prefer sustainable products"

**Verification**:
1. Source 1: Nielsen Global Sustainability Report (2023)
   - Finding: 73% of global consumers willing to change habits for environment
   - Date: Published Q2 2023
   - Reliability: ‚úÖ Reputable market research firm

2. Source 2: IBM Consumer Study (2023)
   - Finding: 71% consider sustainability important
   - Date: Published Q1 2023
   - Reliability: ‚úÖ Major research organization

3. Cross-validation: ‚úÖ Both sources align (~70-73%)

**Revised Claim**: "Approximately 70% of consumers prioritize sustainable products, according to 2023 Nielsen and IBM studies"

**Citation**: Nielsen (2023) Global Sustainability Report; IBM (2023) Consumer Study
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Unverified Claims

**Problem**: Making factual statements without verification

**Solution**:
```markdown
‚ùå "Most people prefer dark mode"
‚úÖ "73% of developers prefer dark mode, according to Stack Overflow's 2023 Developer Survey (n=89,184)"

**Process**:
1. Identify claim needing verification
2. Find credible source
3. Verify with second source
4. Add citation with specifics (%, n, date, source)
```

### Pitfall 2: Jargon Overload

**Problem**: Using technical terms without explanation

**Solution**:
```markdown
‚ùå "Implement a CI/CD pipeline for your application"
‚úÖ "Set up CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)‚Äîa process that automatically tests and deploys your code‚Äîto ship features faster"

**Process**:
1. Identify jargon and acronyms
2. Define on first use
3. Use simple analogy if helpful
4. Consider glossary for technical content
```

### Pitfall 3: Incomplete Information

**Problem**: Leaving reader questions unanswered

**Solution**:
```markdown
**Check for gaps**:
- What questions would a reader have?
- What context is missing?
- What examples would clarify?
- What next steps are needed?

**Add missing elements**:
- Background/context section
- Examples/case studies
- FAQ section
- Next steps/resources
```

### Pitfall 4: Missing Attribution

**Problem**: Using others' ideas/data without credit

**Solution**:
```markdown
**Attribution Protocol**:
1. Track sources during research
2. Use citation management (Zotero, etc.)
3. Add citations during writing, not after
4. Include source links inline
5. Final attribution audit before publishing
```
