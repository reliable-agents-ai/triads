## Voice and Tone

### Voice (Consistent Brand Personality)

**Voice is WHO you are as a brand** (doesn't change):

```markdown
**Voice Dimensions**:

1. **Formality**:
   - Formal: "We recommend you review the documentation"
   - Informal: "Check out the docs"
   - Casual: "Take a peek at the docs!"

2. **Enthusiasm**:
   - Reserved: "This feature is available"
   - Moderate: "This feature is ready to use"
   - Enthusiastic: "This amazing feature is here!"

3. **Technical Level**:
   - Simplified: "It works automatically"
   - Balanced: "The system processes data automatically"
   - Technical: "The automated data pipeline processes records"

4. **Humor**:
   - Serious: "Error occurred. Please try again"
   - Light: "Oops! Something went wrong. Give it another shot"
   - Playful: "Well, that didn't work. Shall we try again?"
```

**Defining Your Voice**:
```markdown
**Exercise**: Select 3-4 adjectives that describe your brand voice

Examples:
- **Authoritative + Clear + Helpful**: "We provide expert guidance with clear explanations to help you succeed"
- **Friendly + Conversational + Approachable**: "We're here to chat with you like a friend and make things easy"
- **Professional + Direct + Efficient**: "We deliver straightforward information efficiently"

**Document**:
We are: [adjective], [adjective], [adjective]
We are NOT: [opposite adjective], [opposite adjective], [opposite adjective]

Example:
We are: Helpful, clear, approachable
We are NOT: Condescending, jargon-heavy, distant
```

### Tone (Adapts to Context)

**Tone is HOW you say things** (changes by situation):

```markdown
**Tone Variations by Context**:

**Success Message**:
- Voice: Friendly, helpful
- Tone: Positive, encouraging
- Example: "Great job! Your article is published and looking fantastic."

**Error Message**:
- Voice: Friendly, helpful
- Tone: Apologetic, solution-oriented
- Example: "Oops! We couldn't publish your article. Let's try saving it as a draft instead."

**Warning**:
- Voice: Friendly, helpful
- Tone: Cautious, informative
- Example: "Heads up: This action will delete your draft. Make sure you want to do this."

**Educational**:
- Voice: Friendly, helpful
- Tone: Patient, clear
- Example: "Let's walk through how to create your first article. It's easier than you think!"

**Urgent**:
- Voice: Friendly, helpful
- Tone: Direct, action-oriented
- Example: "Action needed: Your subscription expires in 3 days. Renew now to keep access."
```

**Tone Adjustment Matrix**:
```markdown
| Context | Formality | Enthusiasm | Empathy |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Success | Moderate | High | Moderate |
| Error | Moderate | Low | High |
| Warning | Formal | Low | Moderate |
| Help | Informal | Moderate | High |
| Sales | Informal | High | Moderate |
```

## Grammar and Mechanics

### Numbers

**AP Style (Common Base)**:
```markdown
✅ **Spell out one through nine**:
- "five people"
- "nine dollars"

✅ **Use numerals for 10 and above**:
- "10 people"
- "150 dollars"

**Exceptions**:
- Ages: "5-year-old", "He is 5 years old"
- Percentages: "5 percent", "10%"
- Money: "$5", "$5 million", "five cents"
- Dimensions: "5-by-7-inch photo"
- Time: "5 p.m.", "5:30 a.m."
- Addresses: "5 Main St."

**Large Numbers**:
- "1 million" (not "1,000,000")
- "5.3 billion"
- "Use commas": 1,000; 10,000; 100,000
```

### Dates and Times

**AP Style**:
```markdown
✅ **Dates**:
- "Jan. 15, 2024" (with year)
- "Jan. 15" (without year)
- Months: Spell out March, April, May, June, July; abbreviate others
- Days: Monday, not Mon.

✅ **Times**:
- "5 p.m.", "10:30 a.m."
- "noon", "midnight" (not 12 p.m., 12 a.m.)
- Avoid :00 → "5 p.m." not "5:00 p.m."

✅ **Time Zones**:
- EST, CST, MST, PST (with time)
- "5 p.m. EST"
```

### Capitalization

**Title Capitalization** (Headline Style):
```markdown
✅ **Capitalize**:
- First word
- Last word
- Nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs
- Both parts of hyphenated words

❌ **Lowercase** (unless first/last word):
- Articles: a, an, the
- Coordinating conjunctions: and, but, or, for, nor
- Prepositions: to, of, in, for, on, with

**Examples**:
✅ "How to Create a Content Marketing Strategy"
✅ "The Ultimate Guide to SEO in 2024"
❌ "How To Create A Content Marketing Strategy"
❌ "The ultimate guide to SEO in 2024"
```

**Sentence Capitalization**:
```markdown
✅ **Capitalize**:
- First word of sentence
- Proper nouns (Google, California, Monday)
- Titles when used with names (President Biden, Dr. Smith)
- Product names (iPhone, WordPress)

❌ **Lowercase**:
- Seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter)
- Titles without names (the president, a doctor)
- Generic terms (website, internet, email)
```

### Punctuation

**Comma**:
```markdown
✅ **Oxford Comma** (recommended for clarity):
- "Red, white, and blue" (with Oxford comma)
- "Red, white and blue" (without Oxford comma)

**AP Style**: No Oxford comma (but use if needed for clarity)
**Chicago/MLA/APA**: Oxford comma required

**Lists**:
- Use commas for 3+ items: "A, B, and C"
- No comma for 2 items: "A and B"
```

**Apostrophe**:
```markdown
✅ **Possessive**:
- Singular: Add 's → "boss's", "James's"
- Plural ending in s: Add ' → "bosses'", "the Joneses'"
- Plural not ending in s: Add 's → "children's", "women's"

✅ **Contractions**:
- "don't", "can't", "it's" (it is)

❌ **Common Errors**:
- "its" (possessive) vs "it's" (it is)
- "your" (possessive) vs "you're" (you are)
- "there" (location) vs "they're" (they are) vs "their" (possessive)
```

**Quotation Marks**:
```markdown
✅ **American Style** (AP, APA):
- Periods and commas inside quotes: She said, "Hello."
- Colons and semicolons outside quotes: "Hello"; then she left.

✅ **British Style**:
- Periods and commas outside quotes: She said, 'Hello'.

**Scare Quotes** (use sparingly):
- Indicate irony or non-standard usage
- Example: The "gourmet" meal was disappointing
```

### Hyphenation

**Compound Modifiers**:
```markdown
✅ **Hyphenate before noun**:
- "well-known author"
- "state-of-the-art technology"
- "high-quality content"

❌ **No hyphen after noun**:
- "The author is well known"
- "The technology is state of the art"

**Age**:
- "5-year-old child" (adjective before noun)
- "The child is 5 years old" (after noun)

**Prefixes**:
- Generally no hyphen: "nonprofit", "email", "coauthor"
- Hyphen if awkward: "re-enter", "co-owner"
- Hyphen before capital: "pre-Civil War"
```

---

## Formatting Conventions

### Lists

**Bulleted Lists**:
```markdown
✅ **Use bullets when**:
- Order doesn't matter
- Items are short (1-2 lines)
- Parallel structure

**Formatting**:
- Capitalize first word
- No period if fragment
- Period if complete sentence
- Parallel structure (all verbs or all nouns)

**Example**:
✅ Parallel (all verbs):
- Write content
- Edit drafts
- Publish articles

❌ Not parallel:
- Write content
- Editing
- Published articles
```

**Numbered Lists**:
```markdown
✅ **Use numbers when**:
- Order matters (steps, priority, ranking)
- Referencing items later

**Formatting**:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

**Substeps**:
1. First step
   a. Sub-step one
   b. Sub-step two
2. Second step
```

### Headings

**Hierarchy**:
```markdown
# H1: Page Title (One per page)
## H2: Main Section
### H3: Subsection
#### H4: Sub-subsection
##### H5: Detail level (rare)

**Best Practices**:
- Don't skip levels (H1 → H3)
- Keep concise (5-8 words)
- Use title case or sentence case (be consistent)
- Make descriptive, not clever
```

### Links

**Link Text**:
```markdown
✅ **Descriptive**:
- "Read our SEO guide"
- "Download the template"
- "Learn about content strategy"

❌ **Generic**:
- "Click here"
- "Read more"
- "This page"

**Formatting**:
- Underline links (standard web convention)
- Different color from body text
- Indicate external links (optional): "Visit Google →"
```

### Emphasis

**Bold vs Italic**:
```markdown
✅ **Bold**:
- Strong emphasis
- Key terms (first use)
- Headings/subheadings
- CTAs (call-to-action)

✅ **Italic**:
- Light emphasis
- Titles of works (books, articles, movies)
- Foreign words
- Technical terms (first use)

❌ **Avoid**:
- CAPS FOR EMPHASIS (looks like shouting)
- Excessive underlining (confusing with links)
- Multiple emphasis (bold + italic + underline)
```

## Brand-Specific Guidelines

**Capitalization**:
```markdown
