# Garden Tending Workflow - Context Memory

**Workflow**: Garden Tending
**Domain**: {{DOMAIN_TYPE}}
**Started**: {{START_DATE}}
**Status**: {{STATUS}}

This file captures context for garden tending workflows (refactoring and quality improvement), ensuring continuity across cultivator ‚Üí pruner ‚Üí gardener-bridge.

## üéØ WORKFLOW PURPOSE

**Objective**: Improve code quality through refactoring, reduce technical debt, eliminate redundancy while maintaining all tests green.

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Code quality improved (measurable metrics)
- [ ] Technical debt reduced
- [ ] All tests still pass (no regressions)
- [ ] No functionality broken
- [ ] Refactoring documented

**Philosophy**: Cultivate growth opportunities, prune redundancy, preserve working systems.

## üìã PRUNER WORK

### 5 Safe Refactoring Rules

**Rules**:
1. ‚úÖ Tests exist and pass BEFORE refactoring
2. ‚úÖ ONE refactoring at a time
3. ‚úÖ Run tests AFTER each refactoring
4. ‚úÖ Commit AFTER each successful refactoring
5. ‚úÖ NEVER change behavior, only structure

### Refactoring Execution

#### Refactoring 1: {{REFACTORING_NAME}}

### Patterns Discovered for Design Triad

```yaml
improvement_patterns:
  - pattern: "Error handling via decorators"
    description: "Eliminated duplication by extracting error handling to decorator"
    benefit: "60 lines removed, consistent error responses"
    recommendation: "Use this pattern for future endpoints"

  - pattern: "Dependency injection for testability"
    description: "Injected dependencies instead of hardcoding"
    benefit: "Easier to mock, test, swap implementations"
    recommendation: "Apply to all new components"
```
