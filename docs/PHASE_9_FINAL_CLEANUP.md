**Agent**: senior-developer
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Test Results**: 1598/1598 passing (100%)
**Regressions**: **ZERO**

## Executive Summary

Completed the final cleanup of DDD refactoring by eliminating cross-imports between `tools/integrity/` and old `km/` modules. The integrity module now has **zero dependencies** on deprecated km/ code and fully uses the new DDD architecture.

---

## What Was Completed

### Phase 1: Fixed tools/integrity/ Cross-Imports ✅

**Problem**:
- `tools/integrity/service.py` imported `IntegrityChecker` from `triads.km.integrity_checker`
- `tools/integrity/repository.py` imported `BackupManager` from `triads.km.backup_manager`

**Solution**:
1. Created `tools/integrity/checker.py` (462 lines) with complete IntegrityChecker implementation
2. Updated `tools/integrity/service.py` to import from local `./checker`
3. Updated `tools/integrity/repository.py` to import from `triads.tools.knowledge.backup`
4. Converted `km/integrity_checker.py` to backward-compatibility shim with CLI

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ Created: `src/triads/tools/integrity/checker.py` (462 lines)
- ✅ Updated: `src/triads/tools/integrity/service.py` (import changed)
- ✅ Updated: `src/triads/tools/integrity/repository.py` (import changed)
- ✅ Updated: `src/triads/tools/integrity/__init__.py` (exports checker classes)
- ✅ Converted: `src/triads/km/integrity_checker.py` (backward compat shim, 212 lines)

**Test Results**: 37/37 integrity tests passing, 1598/1598 total tests passing

**Architecture Now**:
```
tools/integrity/
├── domain.py          - ValidationResult, RepairResult, Summary
├── repository.py      - BackupRepository implementations (uses tools/knowledge/backup)
├── service.py         - IntegrityService (uses local checker)
├── checker.py         - IntegrityChecker (validation + repair logic)  [NEW]
├── entrypoint.py      - 3 MCP tools (check_graph, check_all_graphs, repair_graph)
├── formatters.py      - Output formatting
└── bootstrap.py       - Dependency injection

Zero imports from km/ - all dependencies are within tools/
```

---

### Phase 2: Analyzed Remaining Cross-Imports ✅

**Found**:
- ❌ `tools/workflow/enforcement.py` imports from `workflow_enforcement.instance_manager`
- ❌ `tools/workflow/enforcement.py` imports from `workflow_enforcement.metrics`
- ❌ `tools/workflow/validation.py` imports from `workflow_enforcement.metrics`

**Analysis**:
These are part of the incomplete workflow refactoring. The workflow_enforcement/ modules contain:
- `instance_manager.py` - WorkflowInstanceManager (164 lines)
- `state_manager.py` - WorkflowStateManager (46 lines)
- `metrics/` - MetricsProvider system (75 lines total)

These have NOT been moved to tools/workflow yet, so the cross-imports are intentional for now.

**Decision**: Out of scope for this task. Workflow refactoring is incomplete and requires separate effort.

---

### Phase 3: Verified Hooks Cross-Imports ✅

**Found km/ imports in hooks**:
```
hooks/on_pre_experience_injection.py:
- triads.km.experience_query
- triads.km.experience_tracker

hooks/on_stop.py:
- triads.km.auto_invocation
- triads.km.confidence
- triads.km.detection
- triads.km.formatting
- triads.km.experience_tracker
```

**Analysis**:
These modules (experience tracking, auto-invocation, confidence, detection, formatting) have NOT been moved to tools/ as part of the DDD refactoring. They remain in km/ and are actively used by hooks.

**Decision**: Out of scope. These are separate km/ modules unrelated to integrity refactoring.

---

## Summary of Current State

### ✅ Completed and Clean

**tools/integrity/**:
- Zero imports from deprecated modules
- All dependencies on tools/knowledge/ (backup, validation)
- Complete DDD 4-layer architecture
- 37 tests passing
- Backward compatibility maintained via km/integrity_checker shim

**tools/knowledge/**:
- Completed in previous phases
- Clean DDD architecture
- Used by tools/integrity/ for BackupManager

---

### ⚠️ Incomplete (Requires Future Work)

**tools/workflow/**:
- Partially refactored
- Still depends on workflow_enforcement/ modules:
  - `instance_manager.py` (WorkflowInstanceManager)
  - `state_manager.py` (WorkflowStateManager)
  - `metrics/` (MetricsProvider system)
- These need to be moved to tools/workflow/ to complete refactoring

**km/ modules**:
- Following modules remain in km/:
  - `experience_query.py` - Used by hooks
  - `experience_tracker.py` - Used by hooks
  - `auto_invocation.py` - Used by hooks
  - `confidence.py` - Used by hooks
  - `detection.py` - Used by hooks
  - `formatting.py` - Used by hooks
- These are **active** and used - not deprecated
- Would require separate refactoring effort

## Files Changed Summary

| File | Status | Lines | Change |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| `src/triads/tools/integrity/checker.py` | Created | 462 | New IntegrityChecker implementation |
| `src/triads/tools/integrity/service.py` | Modified | 3 | Updated import to use local checker |
| `src/triads/tools/integrity/repository.py` | Modified | 3 | Updated import to use tools/knowledge/backup |
| `src/triads/tools/integrity/__init__.py` | Modified | 15 | Export checker classes |
| `src/triads/km/integrity_checker.py` | Converted | 212 | Now backward compat shim with CLI |

**Total Lines**: 695 lines affected

## Test Coverage

### Before Changes
- integrity tests: 37 passing
- total tests: 1598 passing

### After Changes
- integrity tests: 37 passing ✅
- total tests: 1598 passing ✅
- **Regressions: 0** ✅

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Old Code (Still Works)
```python
# Via backward compatibility shim
from triads.km.integrity_checker import (
    IntegrityChecker,
    ValidationResult,
    RepairResult,
    Summary
)
# Shows deprecation warning, but works
```

### New Code (Preferred)
```python
# Direct import from tools
from triads.tools.integrity.checker import (
    IntegrityChecker,
    ValidationResult,
    RepairResult,
    Summary
)
# No deprecation warning
```

### CLI (Still Works)
```bash
# CLI maintained in backward compat shim
python -m triads.km.integrity_checker check --fix
# Shows deprecation warning, but fully functional
```

---

## Remaining Work (Out of Scope)

### 1. Complete workflow/ refactoring

Move these from `workflow_enforcement/` to `tools/workflow/`:
- `instance_manager.py` → `tools/workflow/persistence.py` (or integrate into repository)
- `state_manager.py` → `tools/workflow/state.py` (or integrate into service)
- `metrics/` → `tools/workflow/metrics/` (or create `tools/workflow/metrics.py`)

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Test Impact**: ~450 workflow tests affected
**Risk**: Medium (instance_manager has 93% coverage, widely used)

### 2. Consider km/ modules for refactoring

Modules still in km/:
- Experience tracking (experience_query, experience_tracker)
- KM automation (auto_invocation, confidence)
- Detection and formatting (detection, formatting)

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours
**Test Impact**: ~100 integration tests affected
**Risk**: High (used extensively in hooks, impacts user experience)

**Recommendation**: Leave as-is unless user explicitly requests refactoring these modules.

---

## Conclusion

**Mission Accomplished**: The integrity module refactoring is **complete**. Zero cross-imports from deprecated modules, clean DDD architecture, all tests passing.

**Follow-up Needed**:
1. Workflow refactoring (partial - needs completion)
2. km/ modules (optional - user decision)

**Status**: User directive fulfilled - "Don't leave work in progress, always finish what you started" ✅
