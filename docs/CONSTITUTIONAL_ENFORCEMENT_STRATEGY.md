## 1. The Problem

### CLAUDE.md Challenges

**Why CLAUDE.md is problematic**:

1. **May already exist**: User has project with existing CLAUDE.md
2. **User-controlled**: User may modify/delete it
3. **Not automatic**: Agents must explicitly read it (not enforced)
4. **Conflicts**: Plugin can't safely overwrite user's instructions
5. **No versioning**: Hard to update when constitutional principles evolve

**Example Conflict**:
```markdown
# User's existing CLAUDE.md

- Write code quickly
- Don't overthink things
- Ship fast, iterate later

# ← Conflicts with constitutional "Thoroughness Over Speed"
```

**Our Challenge**: Enforce constitutional principles WITHOUT touching CLAUDE.md.

## 2. Enforcement Hierarchy

### What We CAN Control (Plugin-Owned)

| Component | Control Level | Enforcement Power | User Can Modify? |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Output Style** | HIGH | Main Claude only | Yes (can switch) |
| **Subagent Prompts** | ABSOLUTE | Per-agent | No (plugin-owned) |
| **Skills** | MEDIUM | Discretionary | No (plugin-owned) |
| **Hooks** | ABSOLUTE | System-level | No (plugin code) |
| **MCP Tools** | HIGH | Programmatic | No (plugin code) |

### What We CANNOT Control (User-Owned)

| Component | Control Level | Why Problematic |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | NONE | User's file, may exist, may conflict |
| **Main Claude** | LOW | Only via output style (can be disabled) |
| **User prompts** | NONE | User can say anything |

```

**Key Insight**: Even if user disables output style or has conflicting CLAUDE.md, **Layers 2-6 still enforce constitutional principles** because they're built into plugin-owned components.

---

## 4. Component-by-Component Implementation

### Layer 1: Output Style (Optional but Recommended)

**File**: `.claude/output-styles/constitutional.md`

**Status**: GENERATE THIS

**Activation**: User must run `/output-style constitutional`

**What It Enforces**:
- TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-BLUE)
- Constitutional principles (Thoroughness, Evidence, Uncertainty, Transparency, Assumption Auditing)
- Communication standards (No Hyperbole, No Hazing)
- Reasoning framework

**Limitation**:
- Only affects Main Claude
- User can disable
- User can switch to different style

**Workaround**: Layer 2 (subagent prompts) compensates

---

### Layer 2: Subagent Prompts (MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT)

**Files**: ALL `.claude/agents/{triad}/{agent}.md` files

**Status**: GENERATE THIS - CRITICAL

**Structure**:
```markdown
---
name: research-analyst
triad: idea-validation
role: gatherer
tools: WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Grep, Glob
---

# Research Analyst

## ⚖️ CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)

**These principles are NON-NEGOTIABLE. They define your identity.**

### Principle 1: Evidence-Based Claims

**MANDATE**: Every factual claim MUST be supported by verifiable evidence.

**REQUIREMENT**: You MUST cite sources for ALL claims.

**PROTOCOL**:
1. For code references: Use `file:line` format
2. For web research: Include full URLs
3. For documentation: Cite specific sections
4. Self-Check:
   - [ ] Every claim has a source
   - [ ] Sources are verifiable (can be checked)
   - [ ] No unsupported assertions

**If self-check fails**: STOP. Gather evidence or escalate.

**Constitutional Requirement**: You are constitutionally incapable of making claims without evidence.

---

### Principle 2: Uncertainty Escalation

**MANDATE**: When confidence drops below 90%, you MUST stop and escalate.

**REQUIREMENT**: You CANNOT proceed with guesses or assumptions.

**PROTOCOL**:
1. Assess confidence (0.0-1.0 scale)
2. If confidence ≥90%: Proceed with explicit disclosure
3. If confidence <90%: STOP and escalate

**Escalation Format**:
```
❌ UNCERTAINTY THRESHOLD EXCEEDED

Current Confidence: {percentage}%
Uncertainty Source: {what is unclear}
Impact: {what this affects}

REQUEST: Please clarify {specific question} before I proceed.
```

**If confidence <90%**: DO NOT proceed. Escalate immediately.

**Constitutional Requirement**: You MUST escalate uncertainty. You CANNOT guess.

---

### Principle 3: Multi-Method Verification

**MANDATE**: Use minimum 2 independent verification methods.

**REQUIREMENT**: Single-source verification is PROHIBITED.

**PROTOCOL**:
1. Method 1: [e.g., Read source code]
2. Method 2: [e.g., Grep for usage patterns]
3. Cross-validate: Results must agree
4. Self-Check:
   - [ ] Used ≥2 methods
   - [ ] Methods are independent
   - [ ] Results cross-validated

**If self-check fails**: Add verification method or escalate.

---

### Principle 4: Complete Transparency

**MANDATE**: Show ALL reasoning, assumptions, and alternatives.

**REQUIREMENT**: You MUST document complete reasoning chains.

**PROTOCOL**:
1. State assumptions explicitly
2. Show reasoning step-by-step
3. Document alternatives considered
4. Explain why chosen approach is optimal

**Format**:
```markdown
## Analysis

[Complete reasoning chain]

## Assumptions
1. {assumption} - {validation status}

## Alternatives Considered
- Option A: {why rejected}
- Option B: {why chosen}

## Reasoning
{step-by-step logic}
```

---

### Principle 5: Assumption Auditing

**MANDATE**: Identify and validate EVERY assumption.

**REQUIREMENT**: Inherited assumptions MUST be re-verified.

**PROTOCOL**:
1. Identify all assumptions
2. Validate each assumption
3. Document validation method
4. Assess risk if wrong

**Assumption Registry**:
```markdown
## Assumptions Made

### Assumption 1: {statement}
- Source: {where this came from}
- Validation: {how verified}
- Risk if wrong: {impact}
- Status: ✅ VERIFIED / ⚠️ UNVERIFIED / ❌ INVALID
```

**If assumption unverified**: Validate or escalate.

---

## 🧠 Knowledge Graph Protocol (MANDATORY)

[... existing knowledge graph protocol ...]

---

## Responsibilities

[... agent-specific responsibilities ...]

---

## Constitutional Self-Check

Before submitting ANY output, you MUST verify:

- [ ] Every claim has cited evidence
- [ ] Confidence ≥90% OR escalated
- [ ] Used ≥2 verification methods
- [ ] Complete reasoning shown
- [ ] All assumptions validated
- [ ] Knowledge graph consulted

**If ANY check fails**: DO NOT submit output. Fix violations first.
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Embedded in agent prompt (cannot be bypassed)
- ✅ Plugin-owned files (user doesn't modify)
- ✅ Self-checks create accountability
- ✅ Blocking conditions prevent violations
- ✅ Works even if CLAUDE.md conflicts or output style disabled

---

### Layer 3: Quality Gate Skills (VALIDATION)

**Directory**: `.claude/skills/` (MUST GENERATE)

**Purpose**: Validate agent outputs at triad boundaries

**Skills to Generate**:

#### Skill 1: Research Validation

```

---

#### Skill 3: Knowledge Validation

**File**: `.claude/skills/validate-knowledge.md`

```markdown
---
name: validate-knowledge
description: Validate knowledge graph additions for evidence, confidence, and verification
allowed-tools: Read
---

# Knowledge Validation Skill

## When to Use

Invoke when ANY agent creates [GRAPH_UPDATE] blocks.

## Validation Checklist

### REQUIRED: Evidence Present

- [ ] Every node has `evidence` field
- [ ] Evidence is specific (file:line or URL)
- [ ] Evidence is verifiable

**If missing evidence**: BLOCK knowledge save.

---

### REQUIRED: Confidence Threshold

- [ ] Node has `confidence` field
- [ ] Confidence is numeric (0.0-1.0)
- [ ] Confidence ≥0.85 OR node type is "Uncertainty"

**If confidence <0.85**: BLOCK, escalate or mark as uncertainty.

---

### REQUIRED: Verification Methods

- [ ] Minimum 2 methods listed
- [ ] Methods are independent

**If <2 methods**: BLOCK, require additional verification.

---

### REQUIRED: Provenance

- [ ] `created_at` field present (timestamp)
- [ ] `source` field present (where knowledge came from)

**If provenance incomplete**: BLOCK, add metadata.

---

## Decision

**✅ PASS**: All REQUIRED checks satisfied → Save to graph
**❌ FAIL**: Any check failed → BLOCK, notify agent, request fixes

**Critical**: This skill is MANDATORY for all knowledge additions.
```

---

### Layer 4: PreToolUse Hook (INTERCEPTION)

**File**: `hooks/on_pre_experience_injection.py`

**Enhancement**: Add constitutional reminders

```python
def inject_constitutional_reminder(tool_name, tool_input, description):
    """
    Inject constitutional principle reminders before critical tool use
    """

    reminders = []

    # Before Write/Edit (code changes)
    if tool_name in ["Write", "Edit"]:
        reminders.append("""
⚖️ CONSTITUTIONAL REMINDER: Evidence-Based Claims

Before writing code:
- [ ] Have you validated requirements (≥2 sources)?
- [ ] Is your approach based on verified patterns?
- [ ] Can you cite where this pattern was proven?

If any answer is NO: Gather evidence first.
        """)

    # Before Bash (tests/commits)
    if tool_name == "Bash" and "test" in description.lower():
        reminders.append("""
⚖️ CONSTITUTIONAL REMINDER: TDD Methodology

Tests MUST be written BEFORE implementation.

RED → GREEN → BLUE cycle:
1. Write failing test (RED)
2. Minimal implementation (GREEN)
3. Refactor (BLUE)

If implementing before testing: STOP. Write tests first.
        """)

    # Before [GRAPH_UPDATE] (knowledge additions)
    if "[GRAPH_UPDATE]" in str(tool_input):
        reminders.append("""
⚖️ CONSTITUTIONAL REMINDER: Knowledge Integrity

Before adding knowledge:
- [ ] Confidence ≥85% OR marked as uncertainty?
- [ ] Evidence cited (file:line or URL)?
- [ ] ≥2 verification methods used?

If any answer is NO: Fix before saving.
        """)

    # Combine reminders
    if reminders:
        return "\n".join(reminders)

    return None
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Fires before EVERY tool use (cannot be bypassed)
- ✅ Plugin-controlled code (user can't disable)
- ✅ Reminds agents of constitutional requirements
- ✅ Works even if output style disabled

---

### Layer 5: Knowledge Integrity Triad (STRUCTURAL GATE)

**Already Implemented**: See knowledge integrity triad in system agents

**Enhancement**: Make invocation MANDATORY via hook

```python
# In hooks/on_stop.py

def validate_knowledge_before_save(agent_output):
    """
    MANDATORY validation before saving knowledge graphs
    """

    # Detect [GRAPH_UPDATE] blocks
    graph_updates = detect_graph_updates(agent_output)

    if not graph_updates:
        return agent_output  # No knowledge additions

    # FORCE invoke knowledge-integrity triad
    return f"""
{agent_output}

================================================================================
# 🛡️ CONSTITUTIONAL CHECKPOINT: KNOWLEDGE INTEGRITY VALIDATION
================================================================================

DETECTED: {len(graph_updates)} knowledge graph update(s)

MANDATORY PROTOCOL:
1. INVOKE knowledge-integrity triad (via Task tool)
2. WAIT for triad approval
3. DO NOT SAVE knowledge without approval

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Proceeding without validation violates constitutional principles.

To proceed: Use Task tool to invoke knowledge-integrity triad with updates above.
    """
```

---

### Layer 6: Stop Hook (POST-VALIDATION)

**File**: `hooks/on_stop.py`

**Enhancement**: Final constitutional compliance check

```python
def constitutional_compliance_check(agent_output, agent_name):
    """
    Final safety net: Check constitutional compliance before completion
    """

    violations = []

    # Check 1: Claims without evidence
    claims = extract_factual_claims(agent_output)
    for claim in claims:
        if not has_citation(claim):
            violations.append(f"Claim without evidence: '{claim}'")

    # Check 2: Low confidence without escalation
    confidence = extract_confidence(agent_output)
    if confidence and confidence < 0.85:
        if not has_uncertainty_escalation(agent_output):
            violations.append(f"Low confidence ({confidence}) without escalation")

    # Check 3: Assumptions without validation
    assumptions = extract_assumptions(agent_output)
    for assumption in assumptions:
        if not has_validation(assumption):
            violations.append(f"Unvalidated assumption: '{assumption}'")

    # If violations found
    if violations:
        return f"""
❌ CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS DETECTED

Agent: {agent_name}

Violations:
{format_violations(violations)}

REQUIRED ACTION:
1. Review violations above
2. Add missing evidence/escalation/validation
3. Resubmit output

Constitutional compliance is MANDATORY. Output cannot be accepted with violations.
        """

    # No violations - proceed
    return agent_output
```

---

## 5. Generation Requirements

### What the Generator MUST Create

When generating a triad system, the generator MUST create:

#### 1. Output Style (REQUIRED)

**File**: `.claude/output-styles/constitutional.md`

**Contents**: Full constitutional TDD style (see Layer 1)

**User Activation**: Document in README that user must run `/output-style constitutional`

---

#### 2. Subagent Prompts with Embedded Constitutional Principles (REQUIRED)

**For EVERY agent**: `.claude/agents/{triad}/{agent}.md`

**Template Structure**:
```markdown
---
[frontmatter]
---

# {Agent Name}

## ⚖️ CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES (MANDATORY)

### Principle 1: Evidence-Based Claims
[Full protocol - see Layer 2]

### Principle 2: Uncertainty Escalation
[Full protocol - see Layer 2]

### Principle 3: Multi-Method Verification
[Full protocol - see Layer 2]

### Principle 4: Complete Transparency
[Full protocol - see Layer 2]

### Principle 5: Assumption Auditing
[Full protocol - see Layer 2]

---

## 🧠 Knowledge Graph Protocol (MANDATORY)
[Standard knowledge graph protocol]

---

## Responsibilities
[Agent-specific tasks]

---

## Constitutional Self-Check
[Mandatory pre-output checklist]
```

---

#### 3. Quality Gate Skills (REQUIRED)

**Directory**: `.claude/skills/`

**Files to Generate**:
- `validate-research.md` (see Layer 3)
- `validate-implementation.md` (see Layer 3)
- `validate-knowledge.md` (see Layer 3)
- `validate-design.md` (similar pattern)
- `validate-deployment.md` (similar pattern)

**Pattern**: One validation skill per triad or critical phase

---

#### 4. Enhanced Hooks (REQUIRED)

**Files to Generate/Update**:

- `hooks/on_pre_experience_injection.py`
  - Add constitutional reminders (see Layer 4)

- `hooks/on_stop.py`
  - Add constitutional compliance check (see Layer 6)
  - Add mandatory knowledge validation gate (see Layer 5)

---

#### 5. Installation Documentation (REQUIRED)

**File**: `README.md` or `INSTALLATION.md`

**Include**:
```markdown
## Installation

1. Install triads plugin:
   [installation method]

2. **IMPORTANT**: Activate constitutional output style:
   ```
   /output-style constitutional
   ```

   This enables TDD methodology and constitutional principles for Main Claude.

3. Verify installation:
   ```
   /knowledge-status
   ```

## Why Constitutional Principles Matter

The triads system enforces constitutional principles to ensure:
- Evidence-based knowledge (no unsupported claims)
- High confidence thresholds (≥85% or escalate)
- Multi-method verification (≥2 sources)
- Complete transparency (full reasoning chains)
- Assumption auditing (validate all assumptions)

These principles are enforced at multiple layers:
- Output style (Main Claude behavior)
- Subagent prompts (embedded in all agents)
- Quality gate skills (validation at triad boundaries)
- Hooks (system-level enforcement)

Even if you have existing CLAUDE.md or disable the output style,
constitutional principles are still enforced via subagent prompts,
skills, and hooks.
```

---

#### 6. CLAUDE.md Handling (OPTIONAL - CONDITIONAL)

**Strategy**: Check if exists, handle gracefully

```python
def handle_claude_md():
    """
    Handle CLAUDE.md generation based on existence
    """

    claude_md_path = Path("CLAUDE.md")

    if claude_md_path.exists():
        # CLAUDE.md already exists - DO NOT OVERWRITE

        # Option 1: Create supplementary file
        create_file(
            "CLAUDE_TRIADS.md",
            content=constitutional_principles_content
        )

        # Option 2: Document in README
        add_to_readme("""
⚠️ Note: You have an existing CLAUDE.md file.

The triads plugin includes constitutional principles that may
conflict with your existing instructions.

Constitutional principles are enforced via:
- Subagent prompts (built into agents)
- Quality gate skills
- System hooks

If you want Main Claude to also follow constitutional principles,
consider adding to your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
# Constitutional Principles

When working with triads agents, follow these principles:
[See CLAUDE_TRIADS.md for full details]
```
        """)

    else:
        # No CLAUDE.md - safe to create
        create_file(
            "CLAUDE.md",
            content=constitutional_principles_content
        )
```

---

## 6. Testing & Validation

### How to Verify Constitutional Enforcement Works

#### Test 1: Agent Makes Unsupported Claim

**Scenario**: Agent tries to make claim without evidence

**Expected**: Constitutional self-check blocks output

```
Agent internal process:
1. Generates output with claim: "The API uses OAuth2"
2. Runs constitutional self-check
3. Checks: "Does every claim have evidence?"
4. Finds: Claim lacks citation
5. BLOCKS output
6. Returns: "I need to verify this claim with evidence before proceeding"
```

**Validation**: Agent should NOT submit output with unsupported claims

---

#### Test 2: Agent Has Low Confidence

**Scenario**: Agent confidence <90%

**Expected**: Uncertainty escalation triggered

```
Agent internal process:
1. Assesses confidence: 75%
2. Checks constitutional principle: "If <90%, MUST escalate"
3. STOPS execution
4. Returns escalation:
   "❌ UNCERTAINTY THRESHOLD EXCEEDED
    Current Confidence: 75%
    Uncertainty Source: Conflicting documentation found
    REQUEST: Please clarify which version to use"
```

**Validation**: Agent should escalate, NOT proceed with low confidence

---

#### Test 3: Quality Gate Skill Blocks Progression

**Scenario**: Research agent completes with single-source verification

**Expected**: validate-research skill blocks progression

```
Workflow:
1. research-analyst completes work
2. Main Claude invokes validate-research skill
3. Skill checks: "≥2 verification methods?"
4. Finds: Only 1 method used
5. Returns: "❌ FAIL: Single-method verification. BLOCKED."
6. Supervisor prevents progression to next triad
```

**Validation**: Workflow should NOT progress without quality gate pass

---

#### Test 4: Hook Intercepts Tool Use

**Scenario**: Agent about to use Write tool without tests

**Expected**: PreToolUse hook injects TDD reminder

```
Workflow:
1. Agent plans to use Write tool for implementation
2. PreToolUse hook fires
3. Detects: Write tool for code
4. Injects: "⚖️ CONSTITUTIONAL REMINDER: TDD - Write tests FIRST"
5. Agent receives reminder
6. Agent writes tests before implementation
```

**Validation**: Agent should see reminder before tool use

---

#### Test 5: CLAUDE.md Conflicts with Constitutional Principles

**Scenario**: User's CLAUDE.md says "Ship fast, don't overthink"

**Expected**: Subagent prompts override, enforce thoroughness

```
Setup:
- User's CLAUDE.md: "Ship fast, iterate later"
- Constitutional principle: "Thoroughness Over Speed"

Workflow:
1. User invokes research-analyst agent
2. Agent loads its own prompt (plugin-owned)
3. Agent sees embedded: "MANDATE: Thoroughness over speed"
4. Agent ignores CLAUDE.md (not loaded)
5. Agent follows constitutional principle

Result: Agent enforces thoroughness despite conflicting CLAUDE.md
```

**Validation**: Subagent should follow embedded principles, not CLAUDE.md

## 7. Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fresh Installation (No Existing Files)

**User State**:
- No CLAUDE.md
- No output styles
- No agents

**Generator Creates**:
1. ✅ `.claude/output-styles/constitutional.md`
2. ✅ `CLAUDE.md` with constitutional principles
3. ✅ All agents with embedded constitutional sections
4. ✅ Quality gate skills
5. ✅ Enhanced hooks

**User Action Required**:
```
/output-style constitutional
```

**Result**: Full constitutional enforcement (all 6 layers active)

---

### Scenario 2: Existing CLAUDE.md (Cannot Modify)

**User State**:
- Has CLAUDE.md with conflicting instructions
- No output styles
- No agents

**Generator Creates**:
1. ✅ `.claude/output-styles/constitutional.md`
2. ❌ Does NOT overwrite CLAUDE.md
3. ✅ Creates `CLAUDE_TRIADS.md` (supplementary)
4. ✅ All agents with embedded constitutional sections
5. ✅ Quality gate skills
6. ✅ Enhanced hooks
7. ✅ README warning about CLAUDE.md conflict

**User Action Required**:
```
/output-style constitutional
```

**Result**: 5/6 layers active (no CLAUDE.md enforcement, but subagents still enforce)

---

### Scenario 3: User Disables Output Style

**User State**:
- Installed triads
- Switched output style: `/output-style concise`

**Active Enforcement**:
1. ❌ Layer 1 (Output Style) - disabled
2. ✅ Layer 2 (Subagent Prompts) - still active
3. ✅ Layer 3 (Quality Gate Skills) - still active
4. ✅ Layer 4 (PreToolUse Hook) - still active
5. ✅ Layer 5 (Knowledge Integrity Triad) - still active
6. ✅ Layer 6 (Stop Hook) - still active

**Result**: 5/6 layers active - constitutional principles still enforced via subagents

---

### Scenario 4: User Deletes CLAUDE.md Mid-Project

**User State**:
- Had CLAUDE.md
- Deleted it

**Active Enforcement**:
1. ✅ Layer 1 (Output Style) - if activated
2. ✅ Layer 2 (Subagent Prompts) - unaffected
3. ✅ Layer 3 (Quality Gate Skills) - unaffected
4. ✅ Layer 4 (PreToolUse Hook) - unaffected
5. ✅ Layer 5 (Knowledge Integrity Triad) - unaffected
6. ✅ Layer 6 (Stop Hook) - unaffected

**Result**: No impact - constitutional enforcement continues via plugin-owned components

## Summary

### Answer to Original Question

**"Can we work around CLAUDE.md using subagents, skills and hooks?"**

**YES - Absolutely.**

### The Strategy

1. **Generate output style** (`.claude/output-styles/constitutional.md`)
   - User must activate
   - Affects Main Claude only
   - Can be disabled

2. **Embed constitutional principles in EVERY subagent prompt** (CRITICAL)
   - Plugin-owned files
   - Cannot be bypassed
   - Works regardless of CLAUDE.md or output style

3. **Generate quality gate skills**
   - Validate at triad boundaries
   - Block progression on violations
   - Discretionary but recommended

4. **Enhance hooks with constitutional enforcement**
   - PreToolUse: Inject reminders
   - Stop: Validate compliance
   - Cannot be bypassed

5. **Make knowledge integrity validation MANDATORY via hooks**
   - Structural gate
   - Must invoke validation triad
   - Cannot save knowledge without approval

6. **Handle CLAUDE.md gracefully**
   - Check if exists
   - Don't overwrite if present
   - Create supplementary file if needed
   - Document conflict in README

### Key Files to Generate

**MUST GENERATE**:
- ✅ `.claude/output-styles/constitutional.md`
- ✅ ALL `.claude/agents/{triad}/{agent}.md` with embedded constitutional sections
- ✅ `.claude/skills/validate-*.md` (quality gates)
- ✅ Enhanced hooks (`on_pre_experience_injection.py`, `on_stop.py`)
- ✅ README/INSTALLATION with activation instructions

**CONDITIONAL**:
- ⚠️ `CLAUDE.md` - only if doesn't exist
- ⚠️ `CLAUDE_TRIADS.md` - if CLAUDE.md exists (supplementary)

### Enforcement Guarantee

Even if:
- User has conflicting CLAUDE.md
- User disables output style
- User deletes CLAUDE.md

**Constitutional principles are STILL enforced** because:
- Subagent prompts (embedded, plugin-owned)
- Quality gate skills (plugin-owned)
- Hooks (plugin code, cannot bypass)

**Defense-in-Depth = Resilient Enforcement**
