## üìã RELEASE MANAGER WORK

### Version Information

```yaml
version:

    {{WHY_THIS_VERSION_NUMBER}}

semantic_versioning:
  major: "Breaking changes"       # Incompatible API changes
  minor: "New features"           # Backward-compatible features
  patch: "Bug fixes"              # Backward-compatible bug fixes
