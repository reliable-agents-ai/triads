node_type: Entity
label: Entry Point Analyzer Implementation
description: Implemented domain-agnostic workflow entry point analysis with keyword matching, confidence scoring (0.70-0.95), and routing table generation. Analyzes settings.json triad structure to map work types (bug, feature, refactor, release, documentation) to triad entry points.

### Decision: Timezone-Aware Datetime

```markdown
[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: impl_decision_utc_datetime
node_type: Decision
label: Use timezone-aware datetime.now(UTC) for timestamps
description: Replaced deprecated datetime.utcnow() with datetime.now(UTC) to use timezone-aware datetime objects. Generates ISO 8601 timestamps with +00:00 timezone instead of Z suffix.
confidence: 1.0
alternatives: [
  "Keep datetime.utcnow() - rejected: deprecated in Python 3.12+",
  "Use datetime.now(UTC) - chosen: modern, timezone-aware",
  "Convert to Z suffix manually - rejected: unnecessary complexity"
]
rationale: Python 3.12+ deprecates utcnow(). datetime.now(UTC) is recommended modern approach. ISO 8601 accepts both Z and +00:00 for UTC.
evidence: Python 3.12 deprecation warnings, updated test expectations

### Decision: Fallback Triad Selection

```markdown
[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: impl_decision_fallback_triad
node_type: Decision
label: Fallback uses first triad with agents
description: Fallback section selects first triad that has non-empty agents list, not blindly first triad in settings.json. Handles edge case where first triad has no agents.
confidence: 1.0
alternatives: [
  "Use first triad regardless - rejected: fails if first triad has no agents",
  "Use first triad with agents - chosen: robust edge case handling",
  "Require all triads have agents - rejected: too strict"
]
rationale: Defensive programming. Settings.json could have malformed triads with empty agents. Fallback must be reliable.
evidence: test_skips_triads_without_agents passes, coverage 100%

node_type: Task
label: Task 1 Complete - Entry Point Analyzer
description: Successfully implemented Entry Point Analyzer following TDD methodology. All 29 tests passing with 100% coverage. Generates valid routing_decision_table.yaml from settings.json. CLI interface functional. Zero regressions. Ready for Task 2.

## Implementation Summary

**What Was Built**:
- Entry point analyzer with 3 core functions
- Domain-agnostic work type patterns (5 types)
- Keyword-based matching with confidence scoring
- Routing table generation (YAML output)
- CLI interface for standalone execution
- Comprehensive test suite (29 tests)

**TDD Methodology Followed**:
1. **RED Phase**: Wrote 28 tests first - all failed (expected)
2. **GREEN Phase**: Implemented minimal code - all 28 tests passed
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Fixed datetime deprecation, added edge case - 29 tests passing, 100% coverage

**Quality Metrics**:
- Tests: 29/29 passing
- Coverage: 100%
- Regressions: 0
- Code quality: DRY, SOLID, clear naming, type hints, docstrings
- Constitutional compliance: Evidence-based, multi-method verification, complete transparency

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
- [x] File created with complete implementation
- [x] Can run standalone
- [x] Generates valid routing_decision_table.yaml
- [x] Works with real settings.json
- [x] 90%+ coverage (achieved 100%)
- [x] All tests passing

**Next Steps**:
- Task 2: Create coordination skill generator
- Task 3: Integrate into upgrade-executor
