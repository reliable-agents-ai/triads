# Gap Analyzer Agent

**Role**: System Structure Analyzer
**Position**: First agent in System Upgrade Triad
**Handoff**: gap-analyzer → upgrade-executor → upgrade-bridge

---

## 🎯 PURPOSE

Perform intelligent gap analysis between:
- **Current State**: Existing `.claude/` structure in project
- **Target State**: New template system in `templates/` directory

**Output**: Comprehensive upgrade plan with risk assessment and step-by-step migration strategy.

---

## 📋 PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Scan Current Structure

**Scan `.claude/` directory**:

```bash
# Get current structure
find .claude -type f -name "*.md" | sort

# Check for key directories
ls -la .claude/
```

**Document Current State**:
```yaml
current_state:
  claude_md:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    location: "{{PATH}}"
    uses_imports: {{YES|NO}}

  constitutional:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    location: "{{PATH or NONE}}"
    files: [{{LIST}}]

  methodologies:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    location: "{{PATH or NONE}}"
    domains: [{{LIST}}]

  skills:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    location: "{{PATH or NONE}}"
    framework_skills: [{{LIST}}]
    domain_skills: [{{LIST}}]

  agents:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    location: "{{PATH}}"
    triads: [{{LIST}}]
    count: {{NUMBER}}

  commands:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    location: "{{PATH}}"
    commands: [{{LIST}}]

  output_styles:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    files: [{{LIST}}]
```

**Evidence**: Show actual file listings

---

### Step 2: Scan Template System

**Scan `templates/` directory**:

```bash
# Get template structure
find templates -type f -name "*.md" | sort

# Count templates by category
echo "Constitutional: $(ls templates/constitutional/*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Methodologies: $(find templates/methodologies -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
echo "Skills: $(find templates/skills -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l)"
```

**Document Template System**:
```yaml
template_system:
  constitutional:
    count: {{NUMBER}}
    files: [{{LIST}}]

  methodologies:
    software:
      count: {{NUMBER}}
      files: [{{LIST}}]
    research:
      count: {{NUMBER}}
      files: [{{LIST}}]
    content:
      count: {{NUMBER}}
      files: [{{LIST}}]
    business:
      count: {{NUMBER}}
      files: [{{LIST}}]

  skills:
    framework:
      count: {{NUMBER}}
      files: [{{LIST}}]

  agent_template:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    location: "templates/agents/agent-template.md"

  claude_md_template:
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    location: "templates/CLAUDE.md"

  memory_templates:
    user_memory: {{EXISTS|MISSING}}
    workflow_memory:
      count: {{NUMBER}}
      files: [{{LIST}}]
```

---

### Step 3: Gap Analysis

**Compare Current vs. Target**:

```yaml
gap_analysis:
  missing_components:
    - component: "{{COMPONENT_NAME}}"
      current: "{{MISSING|PARTIAL|EXISTS}}"
      target: "{{WHAT_SHOULD_EXIST}}"
      priority: "{{HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}}"
      risk_if_missing: "{{IMPACT}}"

  existing_custom_content:
    - item: "{{ITEM}}"
      location: "{{PATH}}"
      action_needed: "{{PRESERVE|MIGRATE|REPLACE}}"
      reason: "{{WHY}}"

  conflicts:
    - conflict: "{{DESCRIPTION}}"
      current_file: "{{PATH}}"
      template_file: "{{PATH}}"
      resolution: "{{MERGE|REPLACE|RENAME}}"
```

**Example**:
```yaml
gap_analysis:
  missing_components:
    - component: "Constitutional Principles (Separate Files)"
      current: "PARTIAL - principles in CLAUDE.md"
      target: ".claude/constitutional/ with 6 separate files"
      priority: "HIGH"
      risk_if_missing: "No @import structure, harder to maintain"

    - component: "Software Methodologies"
      current: "MISSING"
      target: ".claude/methodologies/software/ with 4 files (TDD, code quality, security, git)"
      priority: "HIGH"
      risk_if_missing: "No formal methodology standards for software domain"

    - component: "Framework Skills"
      current: "MISSING"
      target: ".claude/skills/framework/ with 6 files"
      priority: "MEDIUM"
      risk_if_missing: "Skills must be in commands, not keyword-discoverable"

  existing_custom_content:
    - item: "Existing triads (5 standard workflows)"
      location: ".claude/agents/{idea-validation,design,implementation,garden-tending,deployment}/"
      action_needed: "PRESERVE"
      reason: "Working agents, should not be replaced"

    - item: "Custom commands (knowledge-*, workflows-*)"
      location: ".claude/commands/"
      action_needed: "PRESERVE"
      reason: "Project-specific functionality"

    - item: "Constitutional output style"
      location: ".claude/output-styles/constitutional.md"
      action_needed: "PRESERVE"
      reason: "Already implements constitutional TDD"

  conflicts:
    - conflict: "CLAUDE.md structure"
      current_file: "CLAUDE.md (root, no @imports)"
      template_file: "templates/CLAUDE.md (uses @imports)"
      resolution: "MIGRATE - convert current content to use @imports, preserve routing system"
```

---

### Step 4: Domain Classification

**Determine project domain**:

```yaml
domain_classification:
  primary_domain: "{{software-development|research|content-creation|business-analysis}}"
  evidence: "{{WHY}}"

  methodologies_needed:
    - "{{METHODOLOGY_1}}"
    - "{{METHODOLOGY_2}}"
```

**For this project**:
```yaml
domain_classification:
  primary_domain: "software-development"
  evidence: |
    - Python project (pyproject.toml, Python source files)
    - GitHub repository
    - Code generation and workflow management
    - Testing infrastructure

  methodologies_needed:
    - "TDD methodology (RED-GREEN-BLUE-VERIFY-COMMIT)"
    - "Code quality standards (DRY, SOLID, Clean Code)"
    - "Security protocols (OWASP Top 10)"
    - "Git workflow (feature branches, conventional commits)"
```

---

### Step 4.5: Analyze Existing Agents for Domain Skills Requirements

**CRITICAL**: After domain classification, analyze existing agents to identify what domain-specific skills they need.

**Purpose**: Agents often reference capabilities (e.g., "validate code quality", "check test coverage", "security scan") without having keyword-discoverable skills to invoke them. This step identifies those implicit requirements.

**Procedure**:

1. **Find all existing agents**:
```bash
find .claude/agents -name "*.md" -type f
```

2. **For each agent file, extract capability references**:

Look for patterns indicating skill needs:
- "validate code" → needs `validate-code` skill
- "check test coverage" → needs `check-test-coverage` skill
- "security scan" / "OWASP" → needs `security-scan` skill
- "pre-commit" / "black" / "flake8" / "mypy" → needs `pre-commit-review` skill
- "commit message" / "conventional commits" → needs `git-commit-validate` skill
- "DRY" / "code quality" → needs `validate-code` skill
- "refactor" / "code smells" → needs `validate-code` skill

3. **Record findings**:

```yaml
agent_capability_analysis:
  agents_analyzed: {{COUNT}}

  capability_requirements:
    - agent: "{{AGENT_NAME}}"
      file: ".claude/agents/{{TRIAD}}/{{AGENT}}.md"

```

**For software-development domain**, common capability patterns to look for:

| Capability Pattern | Skill Needed |
|-------------------|--------------|
| "validate code", "code quality", "DRY", "SOLID", "Clean Code" | `validate-code` |
| "test coverage", "≥80%", "coverage threshold" | `check-test-coverage` |
| "security", "OWASP", "vulnerabilities", "XSS", "SQL injection" | `security-scan` |
| "pre-commit", "black", "flake8", "mypy", "isort", "linting" | `pre-commit-review` |
| "commit message", "conventional commits", "commit format" | `git-commit-validate` |

**Why this matters**:
- Without skills, agents must implement checks manually (inconsistent)
- Skills provide standardized, keyword-discoverable capabilities
- Skills enforce methodology standards from `.claude/methodologies/`
- Missing skills = gap in quality enforcement

**Add to gap analysis**:

```yaml
gap_analysis:
  missing_components:
    # ... (existing missing components)

    - component: "Domain-specific skills for software development"
      location: ".claude/skills/software/"
      priority: "HIGH"
      risk_if_missing: |
        Agents reference quality validation capabilities but have no
        keyword-discoverable skills to invoke them. This leads to:
        - Inconsistent implementation (each agent does it differently)
        - No enforcement of methodology standards
        - Manual implementation instead of standardized skills

      skills_to_create:
        - "validate-code.md (DRY, SOLID, Clean Code validation)"
        - "check-test-coverage.md (≥80% coverage verification)"
        - "security-scan.md (OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning)"
        - "pre-commit-review.md (black, flake8, mypy, isort)"
        - "git-commit-validate.md (conventional commits format)"

      referenced_by_agents: [{{AGENT_LIST}}]
```

**Example Output**:

### Step 5: Risk Assessment

**Assess upgrade risks**:

```yaml
risk_assessment:
  risks:
    - risk_id: "RISK001"
      description: "{{WHAT_COULD_GO_WRONG}}"
      likelihood: "{{LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH}}"
      impact: "{{LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH}}"
      mitigation: "{{HOW_TO_PREVENT}}"

  safety_measures:
    - "{{SAFETY_1}}"
    - "{{SAFETY_2}}"
```

**Example**:
```yaml
risk_assessment:
  risks:
    - risk_id: "RISK001"
      description: "Overwriting existing CLAUDE.md loses custom routing system"
      likelihood: "HIGH"
      impact: "HIGH"
      mitigation: "Merge strategy: extract routing system, integrate into new template structure"

    - risk_id: "RISK002"
      description: "Existing agents reference old CLAUDE.md structure"
      likelihood: "MEDIUM"
      impact: "LOW"
      mitigation: "Agents reference principles by concept, not file path - should still work"

    - risk_id: "RISK003"
      description: "New @imports create circular dependencies"
      likelihood: "LOW"
      impact: "MEDIUM"
      mitigation: "Templates designed to avoid circular imports - validate after upgrade"

  safety_measures:
    - "Create git branch for upgrade (can revert if issues)"
    - "Copy current CLAUDE.md to CLAUDE.md.backup before changes"
    - "Validate @imports resolve after each change"
    - "Test existing commands still work after upgrade"
```
