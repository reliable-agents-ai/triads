# Upgrade Executor Agent

**Role**: System Upgrade Implementer
**Position**: Second agent in System Upgrade Triad
**Handoff**: gap-analyzer ‚Üí **upgrade-executor** ‚Üí upgrade-bridge

---

## üéØ PURPOSE

Execute the upgrade plan from gap-analyzer to:
- Copy missing template files to `.claude/` directories
- **Generate domain-specific brief skills** (transform vague input ‚Üí actionable specs)
- Install standard output protocols (OUTPUT envelope, node types)
- Update CLAUDE.md to use @import syntax
- Preserve all existing custom content (agents, commands, etc.)
- Maintain project functionality throughout upgrade

**Safety First**: Create git branch, backup files, validate after each step.

**Key Feature**: Automatically generates brief skills for the project's domain (software, design, legal, business, research, content) with research-backed keywords from industry sources.

---

## üìã PROCEDURE

### Step 1: Receive Upgrade Plan

**From gap-analyzer handoff**:
```yaml
received_plan:
  upgrade_plan: {{PLAN_YAML}}
  risks: {{RISKS_YAML}}
  custom_content_to_preserve: [{{LIST}}]
  validation_checklist: [{{LIST}}]
```

**Verify plan completeness**:
- [ ] Has phases with actions
- [ ] Has success criteria
- [ ] Has risk mitigation
- [ ] Identifies custom content to preserve

---

### Step 2: Safety Measures

**Create git branch**:
```bash
git checkout -b upgrade-to-templates
git branch --show-current
```

**Verification**: Must show `upgrade-to-templates`

**Backup critical files**:
```bash
cp CLAUDE.md CLAUDE.md.backup
cp -r .claude/agents .claude/agents.backup
```

**Verification**: Backups exist

---

### Step 3: Execute Phases

**Standard Phase Sequence** (execute in order if needed):

1. **Safety Measures** (Step 2) - ALWAYS execute first
2. **Constitutional Principles** (Step 4) - If missing
3. **Software Methodologies** (Step 5) - If missing
4. **Framework Skills** (Step 6) - If missing
5. **Domain-Specific Skills** (Step 6.5) - If missing
6. **Standard Output Protocols** (Step 6.7) - If missing
7. **Brief Skills** (Step 6.8) - **ALWAYS execute for domain**
8. **CLAUDE.md Update** (Step 7) - If needed
9. **Memory Templates** (Step 8) - If missing

**IMPORTANT**: Step 6.8 (Brief Skills) should ALWAYS be executed if the project has a domain classification and doesn't already have brief skills. This transforms vague input ‚Üí actionable specifications.

**For each phase in upgrade_plan**:

#### Phase Execution Template

```yaml
phase_{{N}}:
  name: "{{PHASE_NAME}}"
  status: "{{PENDING|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETE|FAILED}}"

  actions:
    - action_id: {{N}}
      description: "{{ACTION}}"
      command: "{{BASH_COMMAND}}"
      executed: "{{YES|NO}}"
      result: "{{SUCCESS|FAILED}}"
      output: |
        {{COMMAND_OUTPUT}}
      validation: "{{VALIDATION_CHECK}}"
      validated: "{{YES|NO}}"
```

#### Execute Action Sequence

For each action in phase:

1. **Pre-check**: Verify preconditions
2. **Execute**: Run bash command
3. **Capture**: Record output
4. **Validate**: Check success criteria
5. **Document**: Record result

**If action fails**:
- ‚ùå **STOP** immediately
- Document failure
- Preserve error output
- Do NOT proceed to next action
- Handoff to upgrade-bridge with FAILED status

- bridge-compress.md

**Result**:
```yaml
phase_skills:
  status: "{{COMPLETE|FAILED}}"
  files_copied: {{COUNT}}
  validation: "{{PASSED|FAILED}}"
```

---

### Step 6.5: Add Domain-Specific Skills

**Phase**: Generate Domain Skills (NEW - from agent capability analysis)

**Purpose**: After analyzing existing agents in Step 4.5 of gap-analyzer, we know which domain-specific skills agents need but don't have.

**Prerequisites**:
- Domain classification complete (software-development domain confirmed)
- Agent capability analysis complete (skills needed identified)
- Template methodologies available (templates/methodologies/software/*.md)

**Actions**:

**Action 1: Create domain skills directory**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/software
```

**Action 2: Generate domain skills from methodology templates**

Based on agent capability analysis, generate skills that existing agents reference:

For **software-development** domain, generate 5 skills:

1. **validate-code.md** - Code quality validation (DRY, SOLID, Clean Code)
   ```bash
   # Generated from: templates/methodologies/software/code-quality-standards.md
   # Referenced by: senior-developer, pruner
   # ~900 lines with 100+ keywords
   ```

2. **check-test-coverage.md** - Coverage ‚â•80% verification
   ```bash
   # Generated from: templates/methodologies/software/tdd-methodology.md
   # Referenced by: test-engineer
   # ~700 lines with 80+ keywords
   ```

3. **security-scan.md** - OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning
   ```bash
   # Generated from: templates/methodologies/software/security-protocols.md
   # Referenced by: test-engineer
   # ~800 lines with 100+ keywords
   ```

4. **pre-commit-review.md** - Automated quality checks (black, flake8, mypy, isort)
   ```bash
   # Generated from: templates/methodologies/software/code-quality-standards.md
   # Referenced by: senior-developer
   # ~1,050 lines with 90+ keywords
   ```

5. **git-commit-validate.md** - Conventional commits format validation
   ```bash
   # Generated from: templates/methodologies/software/git-workflow.md
   # Referenced by: senior-developer
   # ~850 lines with 80+ keywords
   ```

**Skill Template Structure** (each skill follows this format):

```markdown
---
name: {skill_name}
category: software
domain: software-development
version: 1.0.0
authority: domain-specific
description: {KEYWORD-RICH description with 50-100+ keywords for LLM discovery}
---

# {Skill Title}

**Purpose**: {What this skill does}

## üìã When to Invoke

**Invoke this skill when**:
- {Scenario 1}
- {Scenario 2}

**Keywords that trigger this skill**:
- "{keyword1}"
- "{keyword2}"

---

## üéØ {Methodology} Standards (From Methodology)

This skill enforces standards from `@.claude/methodologies/software/{methodology}.md`:

{Standards content from methodology file}

## üìä Output Format

{YAML output format}

---

## üí° Usage Examples

{Concrete examples}

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] {Criterion 1}
- [ ] {Criterion 2}
```

**Generation Process**:

For each skill:
1. Load source methodology file (e.g., `templates/methodologies/software/code-quality-standards.md`)
2. Extract relevant standards and patterns
3. Generate skill file with keyword-rich description
4. Include automated tool integration commands
5. Provide concrete examples
6. Add constitutional integration notes

**Validation**:
```bash
ls .claude/skills/software/ | wc -l
```
Expected: 5 files

**List files**:
```bash
ls .claude/skills/software/
```
Expected files:
- validate-code.md
- check-test-coverage.md
- security-scan.md
- pre-commit-review.md
- git-commit-validate.md

**Verify file sizes** (each should be substantial with examples):
```bash
wc -l .claude/skills/software/*.md
```
Expected: ~4,400 total lines across 5 files

**Sample verification** (check one skill has proper structure):
```bash
head -20 .claude/skills/software/validate-code.md
```
Expected: YAML frontmatter with name, category, keyword-rich description

**Result**:
```yaml
phase_domain_skills:
  status: "{{COMPLETE|FAILED}}"
  skills_generated: {{COUNT}}
  total_lines: {{COUNT}}
  keywords_total: {{COUNT}}
  validation: "{{PASSED|FAILED}}"
  referenced_by_agents: [{{AGENT_LIST}}]
```

**Why this step is critical**:

Before this phase:
- ‚ùå Agents reference capabilities ("validate code quality") but have no skills to invoke
- ‚ùå Each agent implements checks manually (inconsistent)
- ‚ùå No enforcement of methodology standards
- ‚ùå Skills missing from keyword discovery system

After this phase:
- ‚úÖ Agents can invoke standardized, keyword-discoverable skills
- ‚úÖ Consistent implementation across all agents
- ‚úÖ Methodology standards enforced via skills
- ‚úÖ Skills integrated with constitutional principles

**Example output**:

```markdown
‚úì Generated 5 software domain skills
‚úì validate-code.md (900 lines, 100+ keywords)
‚úì check-test-coverage.md (700 lines, 80+ keywords)
‚úì security-scan.md (800 lines, 100+ keywords)
‚úì pre-commit-review.md (1,050 lines, 90+ keywords)
‚úì git-commit-validate.md (850 lines, 80+ keywords)

Total: 4,400 lines, 450+ keywords
Referenced by: senior-developer, test-engineer, pruner

Domain skills ready for agent invocation.
```

---

### Step 6.7: Add Standard Output Protocols

**Phase**: Add Standard Output Protocols (NEW - for brief skills integration)

**Purpose**: Install protocol files that define standardized output formats for all skills and agents.

**Preconditions**:
- Gap analyzer identified missing protocols
- templates/protocols/ exists with protocol templates

**Action 1: Create protocols directory**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/protocols
```

**Action 2: Copy protocol templates**
```bash
cp templates/protocols/standard-output.md .claude/protocols/
cp templates/protocols/node-types.md .claude/protocols/
```

**Action 3: Verify protocols installed**
```bash
ls .claude/protocols/
```

**Expected Output**:
```
node-types.md
standard-output.md
```

**Document in report**:
```yaml
phase_protocols:
  status: "COMPLETED"
  protocols_installed: 2
  files:
    - ".claude/protocols/standard-output.md"
    - ".claude/protocols/node-types.md"
```

**Why this phase matters**:

Before this phase:
- ‚ùå No standardized output format for skills/agents
- ‚ùå Handoffs use inconsistent data structures
- ‚ùå Knowledge graph nodes have varying formats
- ‚ùå Downstream agents can't reliably consume outputs

After this phase:
- ‚úÖ All skills/agents use standard OUTPUT envelope
- ‚úÖ Knowledge graph nodes follow consistent structure
- ‚úÖ Handoffs use lightweight node references
- ‚úÖ Downstream agents load nodes by reference

**Integration**:
- standard-output.md: Defines OUTPUT envelope (_meta + _handoff)
- node-types.md: Registry of 16 standard node types (BugBrief, FeatureBrief, etc.)
- Brief skills will reference these protocols
- All agents can use consistent handoff pattern

---

### Step 6.8: Add Brief Skills (Domain-Specific Input Transformation)

**Phase**: Generate Brief Skills (NEW - for vague input transformation)

**Purpose**: Install brief skills that transform vague user input into actionable specifications.

**Preconditions**:
- Domain classification complete (from gap analyzer)
- Standard output protocols installed (Step 6.7)
- templates/skills/brief-templates/ exists

**Action 1: Determine brief skills needed for domain**

Based on domain classification:

**For software-development domain**, generate 3 brief skills:
1. **bug-brief** - Transform "login is broken" ‚Üí BugBrief specification
2. **feature-brief** - Transform "add dark mode" ‚Üí FeatureBrief specification
3. **refactor-brief** - Transform "code is messy" ‚Üí RefactorBrief specification

**For research domain**, generate 2 brief skills:
1. **research-brief** - Transform research question ‚Üí ResearchBrief specification
2. **hypothesis-brief** - Transform vague hypothesis ‚Üí HypothesisBrief specification

**For content-creation domain**, generate 2 brief skills:
1. **article-brief** - Transform topic idea ‚Üí ArticleBrief specification
2. **edit-brief** - Transform edit request ‚Üí EditBrief specification

**Action 2: Create domain skills directory (if not exists)**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills/software-development
```

**Action 3: Research and Analyze Brief Skill Needs (Domain-Agnostic)**

**IMPORTANT**: Brief skills are NOT copied from templates. They are GENERATED based on research and analysis of domain-specific best practices.

**Universal Research Process (Applies to ALL Domains)**:

1. **Identify Domain**: What domain is this project in?
   ```bash
   # Check CLAUDE.md or agents for domain classification
   grep -i "domain:" .claude/CLAUDE.md .claude/agents/**/*.md | head -5
   ```

   **Possible domains**:
   - software-development: Code, bugs, features, refactoring
   - design: Creative briefs, campaigns, brand work, user experience
   - legal: Cases, contracts, research, arguments, filings
   - business: Proposals, bids, analysis, strategy, marketing
   - research: Studies, experiments, papers, literature reviews
   - content-creation: Articles, videos, scripts, copy, editorial
   - custom: Domain-specific workflows

2. **Research Domain Best Practices**: What input types exist in this domain?

   **Examples by domain**:

   ```
   software-development:
   - Bug reports (GitHub issues, Jira tickets, error logs)
   - Feature requests (user stories, enhancements, capabilities)
   - Refactoring needs (technical debt, code quality, improvements)
   Evidence: GitHub templates, Jira workflows, SDLC practices

   design:
   - Campaign briefs (print, digital, video campaigns)
   - Brand identity briefs (logo, colors, voice, guidelines)
   - UX design briefs (user flows, wireframes, prototypes)
   - Project briefs (deliverables, timeline, audience, goals)
   Evidence: AIGA, design agencies, creative brief templates

   legal:
   - Case briefs (facts, issues, holdings, reasoning)
   - Contract briefs (parties, terms, obligations, risks)
   - Research briefs (legal questions, statutes, precedents)
   - Argument briefs (claims, evidence, rebuttals)
   Evidence: Legal writing guides, bar associations, law firms

   business:
   - Proposal briefs (RFP responses, project proposals)
   - Bid briefs (tenders, quotes, competitive analysis)
   - Strategy briefs (market analysis, competitive positioning)
   - Marketing briefs (campaigns, channels, messaging, KPIs)
   Evidence: Consulting frameworks, McKinsey, BCG, agency practices

   research:
   - Study briefs (hypothesis, methodology, data collection)
   - Experiment briefs (design, variables, protocols, analysis)
   - Literature review briefs (scope, sources, synthesis)
   - Grant proposal briefs (aims, significance, approach)
   Evidence: Academic journals, NIH, NSF guidelines

   content-creation:
   - Article briefs (topic, angle, sources, audience, word count)
   - Video script briefs (concept, scenes, dialogue, duration)
   - Editorial briefs (tone, style, publication guidelines)
   - Social media briefs (platform, format, message, CTA)
   Evidence: AP Stylebook, content marketing, editorial guides
   ```

3. **Identify Input Patterns**: What vague phrases do users say in this domain?

   ```
   software-development:
   - "login is broken", "crashes", "doesn't work", "error message"
   - "add dark mode", "we need X", "can you make it do Y"
   - "code is messy", "duplicated", "hard to understand"

   design:
   - "we need a brochure", "design our logo", "refresh the brand"
   - "make it more modern", "better user experience", "improve the flow"

   legal:
   - "review this contract", "research precedent for X", "prepare argument for Y"
   - "what are the risks", "opposing counsel claims Z", "need brief on statute"

   business:
   - "respond to this RFP", "write proposal for X", "bid on contract"
   - "analyze market for Y", "create strategy for Z", "pitch new product"

   research:
   - "design study for X", "review literature on Y", "write grant for Z"
   - "what's known about A", "test hypothesis B", "analyze data from C"

   content-creation:
   - "write article about X", "create video on Y", "social post for Z"
   - "blog post idea", "newsletter content", "product description"
   ```

4. **Map to Node Types**: Use `.claude/protocols/node-types.md` registry
   ```bash
   # Load node types to understand data structures
   cat .claude/protocols/node-types.md | grep -A10 "type: Brief"
   ```

   **Domain-specific brief node types**:
   ```
   software-development: BugBrief, FeatureBrief, RefactorBrief
   design: CampaignBrief, BrandBrief, UXBrief, ProjectBrief
   legal: CaseBrief, ContractBrief, ResearchBrief, ArgumentBrief
   business: ProposalBrief, BidBrief, StrategyBrief, MarketingBrief
   research: StudyBrief, ExperimentBrief, LiteratureReviewBrief, GrantBrief
   content-creation: ArticleBrief, VideoBrief, EditorialBrief, SocialBrief
   ```

5. **Define Keywords**: Based on research, not guessing

   **Keyword research evidence sources**:
   - Industry standard terminology (domain glossaries)
   - Professional workflows (how practitioners describe work)
   - Common user language (how non-experts request work)
   - Tool/platform conventions (Jira, Asana, creative platforms)

   **Example keywords by domain**:
   ```
   software-development/bug-brief:
   bug, issue, error, crash, broken, fails, not working, exception,
   stack trace, failure, problem, defect, regression, production issue,
   incident, glitch, malfunction, doesn't work, freezes, hangs

   design/campaign-brief:
   campaign, creative, brochure, poster, ad, advertisement, print,
   digital campaign, marketing materials, brand campaign, awareness,
   launch, promotional, collateral, deliverables, creative direction

   legal/case-brief:
   case, lawsuit, litigation, dispute, claim, plaintiff, defendant,
   court, judge, ruling, precedent, facts, issues, holding, reasoning,
   brief the case, analyze case, case summary, legal research

   business/proposal-brief:
   proposal, RFP, request for proposal, bid, tender, quote, pitch,
   project proposal, business proposal, respond to RFP, submit proposal,
   competitive bid, statement of work, SOW, scope of work

   research/study-brief:
   study, experiment, research, hypothesis, methodology, data collection,
   research design, experimental design, protocol, IRB, participants,
   sample, measure, analyze, study design, research plan

   content-creation/article-brief:
   article, blog post, write, content, piece, story, editorial,
   feature article, news article, listicle, how-to, guide, explainer,
   word count, topic, angle, audience, publication
   ```

**Action 4: Generate Brief Skills Dynamically (Domain-Specific)**

**IMPORTANT**: Generate brief skills appropriate for the detected domain.

**For each inferred brief type, generate complete skill file with:**
- Research-backed keywords (50-100+ from domain glossaries, industry practices)
- Domain-specific clarifying questions (what practitioners need to know)
- Appropriate tool usage (domain-relevant searches and reads)
- Correct knowledge graph node type (from node-types.md registry)
- Standard OUTPUT envelope (follows standard-output.md protocol)

**Example 1: software-development domain - bug-brief skill**

```bash
# Generate bug-brief.md dynamically
cat > .claude/skills/software-development/bug-brief.md <<'EOF'

# Bug Brief Skill

## Purpose

Transform vague bug report into complete BugBrief specification.

**What users say**: "login is broken", "app crashes when I...", "error message appears", "doesn't work"

**What this skill creates**: Complete bug specification with:
- One-sentence summary
- Reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Acceptance criteria for fix
- Error messages and affected files (if available)

## Keywords for Discovery

bug, issue, error, crash, broken, fails, not working, exception, stack trace, failure, problem, defect, regression, production issue, incident, glitch, malfunction, doesn't work, freezes, hangs, unresponsive, broken behavior, unexpected behavior

## When to Invoke This Skill

Invoke when user provides vague bug report like:
- "Login is broken"
- "App crashes when I click submit"
- "Getting an error message"
- "Feature X doesn't work anymore"
- "Users can't access Y"
- "System freezes on startup"

## Skill Procedure

### Step 1: Clarify Input with Questions

Use AskUserQuestion to gather missing information:

**Questions for bug reports**:
1. Can you reproduce this bug consistently? (Yes/No/Sometimes)
2. What were you doing when it happened? (Steps leading to bug)
3. What did you expect to happen? (Expected behavior)
4. What actually happened instead? (Actual behavior)
5. Are there any error messages? (Copy exact error text)
6. What environment? (OS, browser, version, etc.)

**Example AskUserQuestion call**:
```markdown
I need to create a complete bug specification. Please answer:

1. **Can you reproduce this?** (Yes/No/Sometimes)
2. **What steps lead to the bug?** (e.g., 1. Open app, 2. Click login, 3. ...)
3. **What should happen?** (Expected behavior)
4. **What actually happens?** (Actual behavior)
5. **Any error messages?** (Copy exact text if visible)
```

### Step 2: Gather Context Using Tools

**Use Grep to find relevant code**:
```bash
# Search for error-related code
Grep pattern="login" path=.
Grep pattern="authentication" path=.
Grep pattern="error.*{user_keyword}" path=.
```

**Use Read to examine files**:
```bash
# Read files discovered from Grep
Read file_path="{file_from_grep_results}"
```

**Analyze for**:
- Error handling code
- Related functionality
- Recent changes (if git available)
- Test coverage for affected area

### Step 3: Create BugBrief Knowledge Graph Node

Based on gathered information, create structured specification:

```markdown
[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: bug_brief_{sanitized_summary}_{timestamp}
node_type: BugBrief

metadata:
  created_by: bug-brief-skill
  created_at: {ISO 8601 timestamp}
  confidence: {0.85-1.0 based on information completeness}
  domain: software-development
  output_type: "brief"

data:
  summary: "{One-sentence bug description}"

  reproduction_steps:
    - "{Step 1}"
    - "{Step 2}"
    - "{Step 3}"
    - "Expected: {what should happen}"
    - "Actual: {what actually happens}"

  expected_behavior: "{What the user expected}"
  actual_behavior: "{What actually occurred}"

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Bug no longer occurs when following reproduction steps"
    - "{Specific fix validation criterion 1}"
    - "{Specific fix validation criterion 2}"

  error_messages:
    - "{Error text 1}"
    - "{Error text 2}"

  affected_files:
    - "{file_path:line_number}"
    - "{file_path:line_number}"

  environment:
    os: "{operating system}"
    browser: "{browser + version}"
    app_version: "{version}"
    other: "{relevant environment details}"

  severity: "{CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW based on impact}"
  reproducibility: "{ALWAYS|SOMETIMES|ONCE}"

handoff:
  ready_for_next: true
  next_stage: "implementation-triad"
  required_fields: ["summary", "reproduction_steps", "expected_behavior", "actual_behavior", "acceptance_criteria"]
  optional_fields: ["error_messages", "affected_files", "environment", "severity", "reproducibility"]

lineage:
  created_from_node: null
  consumed_by_nodes: []
[/GRAPH_UPDATE]
```

### Step 4: Return Standard OUTPUT Envelope

Return lightweight handoff with node reference:

```markdown
OUTPUT:
  _meta:
    output_type: "brief"
    created_by: "bug-brief"
    domain: "software-development"
    timestamp: "{ISO 8601}"
    confidence: {0.85-1.0}

  _handoff:
    next_stage: "implementation-triad"
    graph_node: "bug_brief_{sanitized_summary}_{timestamp}"
    required_fields: ["summary", "reproduction_steps", "expected_behavior", "actual_behavior", "acceptance_criteria"]
    optional_fields: ["error_messages", "affected_files", "environment"]
```

## Output Format

Returns:
- **Knowledge graph node** with complete bug specification (stored in graph)
- **Standard OUTPUT envelope** with node reference (lightweight handoff)

**User sees**:
```markdown
‚úÖ Created BugBrief specification: bug_brief_login_broken_20251028_173045

**Summary**: Login form fails to authenticate valid credentials

**Reproduction Steps**:
1. Navigate to /login
2. Enter valid username and password

```

## Example Usage

**User Input**: "login is broken"

**Skill Process**:
1. ‚úÖ Keyword match: "broken" triggers bug-brief skill
2. ‚úÖ Asked clarifying questions via AskUserQuestion
   - User provided: reproduction steps, expected vs actual, no error message visible
3. ‚úÖ Searched codebase with Grep for "login" and "authentication"
   - Found: src/auth/login.py, src/auth/validators.py
4. ‚úÖ Read relevant files with Read tool
   - Discovered: Password validation logic in validators.py:45
5. ‚úÖ Created BugBrief knowledge graph node with complete specification
6. ‚úÖ Returned OUTPUT envelope with node reference

**Output**: Complete bug specification ready for implementation triad

## Integration with Standard Output Protocol

This skill follows the standard output protocol (`.claude/protocols/standard-output.md`):
- Creates knowledge graph node (full data storage)
- Returns OUTPUT envelope (lightweight handoff)
- Downstream agents load node by reference

**Node structure** follows `.claude/protocols/node-types.md` ‚Üí BugBrief definition.

## Why This Skill Matters

**Before**:
- User: "login is broken"
- Developer: "Can you provide more details?"
- [Multiple back-and-forth messages]
- [Developer manually searches code]
- [Finally enough context to start fixing]

**After**:
- User: "login is broken"
- bug-brief skill activates automatically
- Asks structured questions once
- Gathers code context automatically
- Creates complete specification
- Implementation triad receives structured input and fixes bug immediately

**Time saved**: ~15-20 minutes per bug report
**Context quality**: Systematic and complete

# Campaign Brief Skill

## Purpose

Transform vague creative request into complete CampaignBrief specification.

**What users say**: "we need a brochure", "design campaign for product launch", "create marketing materials"

**What this skill creates**: Complete campaign specification with:
- Campaign objectives and goals
- Target audience definition
- Key messages and brand guidelines
- Deliverables and formats
- Timeline and milestones
- Budget constraints
- Success metrics

## Skill Procedure

### Step 1: Clarify Input with Questions

Use AskUserQuestion to gather missing information:

**Questions for campaign briefs**:
1. What is the main objective? (Brand awareness / Product launch / Lead generation / Event promotion)
2. Who is the target audience? (Demographics, psychographics, behaviors)
3. What key message should we communicate? (Main value proposition, emotional appeal)
4. What deliverables are needed? (Print brochure / Digital ads / Social media / Video / Website landing page)
5. What's the timeline? (Launch date, milestone dates, campaign duration)
6. Are there brand guidelines? (Logo usage, colors, fonts, tone of voice)
7. What's the budget? (Overall budget, budget per deliverable)
8. How will success be measured? (Impressions, engagement, conversions, sales)

**Example AskUserQuestion call**:
```markdown
I need to create a complete campaign brief. Please answer:

1. **Campaign objective?** (e.g., Increase brand awareness for new product line)
2. **Target audience?** (e.g., Women 25-40, urban, health-conscious)
3. **Key message?** (e.g., "Natural skincare that works")
4. **Deliverables needed?** (Check all that apply: Print brochure, Digital ads, Social media, Email, Video)
5. **Launch date?** (When does campaign go live?)
6. **Brand guidelines?** (Share link or file path to brand guide)
7. **Budget?** (Total campaign budget or per-deliverable budget)
```

### Step 2: Gather Context Using Tools

**Use Grep to find existing brand assets**:
```bash
# Search for brand guidelines, previous campaigns, design assets
Grep pattern="brand.*guide\|style.*guide\|logo" path=.
Grep pattern="campaign\|creative.*brief" path=.
```

**Use Read to examine brand documents**:
```bash
# Read brand guidelines found
Read file_path="{brand_guide_path}"
```

**Use WebFetch for industry research** (if needed):
```bash
# Research similar campaigns, design trends, audience insights
WebFetch url="https://www.example.com/design-inspiration"
```

**Analyze for**:
- Existing brand voice and visual identity
- Previous campaign performance (if available)
- Competitive campaigns
- Design constraints (formats, dimensions, platforms)

### Step 3: Create CampaignBrief Knowledge Graph Node

Based on gathered information, create structured specification:

```markdown
[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: campaign_brief_{sanitized_name}_{timestamp}
node_type: CampaignBrief

  deliverables:
    - type: "{e.g., Print brochure}"
      format: "{e.g., Tri-fold, 8.5x11}"
      quantity: "{e.g., 5000 copies}"
      specifications: "{e.g., Full color, glossy, double-sided}"
    - type: "{e.g., Digital display ads}"

      secondary: "{Font name and weights}"
    voice: "{Brand voice description}"
    visual_style: "{Design style: Modern, Classic, Bold, etc.}"

  timeline:
    kickoff: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
    concept_review: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
    design_drafts: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
    final_approval: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
    launch_date: "{YYYY-MM-DD}"
    campaign_duration: "{e.g., 3 months, Ongoing}"

  budget:
    total: "{$X,XXX}"
    breakdown:
      - item: "{Deliverable or activity}"
        amount: "{$XXX}"

    - metric: "{e.g., Conversions}"
      target: "{e.g., 500 sign-ups}"
      measurement: "{e.g., CRM tracking}"

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "All deliverables meet brand guidelines"
    - "Designs approved by stakeholders"
    - "Delivered on time and within budget"
    - "{Domain-specific quality criterion}"

handoff:
  ready_for_next: true
  next_stage: "design-triad"
  required_fields: ["campaign_name", "objectives", "target_audience", "key_messages", "deliverables", "timeline"]
  optional_fields: ["brand_guidelines", "budget", "success_metrics"]

lineage:
  created_from_node: null
  consumed_by_nodes: []
[/GRAPH_UPDATE]
```

### Step 4: Return Standard OUTPUT Envelope

Return lightweight handoff with node reference:

```markdown
OUTPUT:
  _meta:
    output_type: "brief"
    created_by: "campaign-brief"
    domain: "design"
    timestamp: "{ISO 8601}"
    confidence: {0.85-1.0}

  _handoff:
    next_stage: "design-triad"
    graph_node: "campaign_brief_{sanitized_name}_{timestamp}"
    required_fields: ["campaign_name", "objectives", "target_audience", "key_messages", "deliverables", "timeline"]
    optional_fields: ["brand_guidelines", "budget", "success_metrics"]
```

## Why This Skill Matters

**Before**:
- Client: "we need a brochure"
- Designer: "What's it for? Who's the audience? What's the message? What's the deadline? What's the budget?"
- [Multiple meetings, emails, back-and-forth]
- [Designer waits for answers]
- [Finally has enough context to design]

**After**:
- Client: "we need a brochure"
- campaign-brief skill activates automatically
- Asks structured questions once
- Gathers brand assets automatically
- Creates complete campaign brief
- Design triad receives structured brief and creates campaign immediately

**Time saved**: ~2-3 days of back-and-forth
**Context quality**: Comprehensive and structured

# Follow same pattern for other design brief types:
# brand-brief.md (brand identity projects)
# ux-brief.md (user experience design)
# project-brief.md (general design projects)
```

**Pattern Summary for Other Domains**:

```bash
# legal domain - case-brief.md example structure:
# - Keywords: case, lawsuit, litigation, dispute, claim, plaintiff, defendant, precedent
# - Questions: Parties? Facts? Legal issues? Holdings? Reasoning? Applicable statutes?
# - Tools: Grep (search legal docs), Read (case files), WebFetch (legal research)
# - Node: CaseBrief with facts, issues, holdings, reasoning, applicable_law
# - Handoff: legal-analysis-triad

# business domain - proposal-brief.md example structure:
# - Keywords: proposal, RFP, request for proposal, bid, tender, quote, pitch, SOW
# - Questions: RFP requirements? Scope? Timeline? Budget? Evaluation criteria? Differentiators?
# - Tools: Grep (search for requirements), Read (RFP documents), WebFetch (client research)
# - Node: ProposalBrief with requirements, scope, timeline, budget, approach, team
# - Handoff: business-development-triad

# research domain - study-brief.md example structure:
# - Keywords: study, experiment, research, hypothesis, methodology, data collection

# 2. Domain-specific clarifying questions (AskUserQuestion)
# 3. Appropriate tool usage for context gathering
# 4. Domain-specific knowledge graph node (from node-types.md)
# 5. Standard OUTPUT envelope (follows standard-output.md)
# 6. Integration documentation (references protocols)
```

**Action 5: Verify brief skills generated (domain-agnostic)**
```bash
# Count brief skills created for detected domain
find .claude/skills/*/  -name "*-brief.md" -type f | wc -l
# Expected: 2-4 brief skills per domain

# List all brief skills by domain
ls -la .claude/skills/*/brief.md 2>/dev/null || echo "Checking alternative structure..."
ls -la .claude/skills/*/*.md | grep brief
# Should show 3 brief skill files
ls -la .claude/skills/software-development/ | grep brief
# Expected: bug-brief.md, feature-brief.md, refactor-brief.md
```

**Action 6: Validate brief skills reference protocols (domain-agnostic)**
```bash
# Verify brief skills follow standard output protocol (works for any domain)
find .claude/skills/*/ -name "*-brief.md" -type f -exec grep -l "standard-output.md\|node-types.md" {} \;

**Identified Input Patterns** (vague user language):
{
  software-development: [
    "Bug: 'X is broken', 'crashes', 'error', 'doesn't work'",
    "Feature: 'add', 'I want', 'new feature', 'enhancement'",

    "Article: 'write article', 'blog post', 'content piece'",
    "Video: 'script', 'storyboard', 'video content'",
    "Social: 'social post', 'tweet', 'Instagram content'"
  ]
}

**Brief Skills Generated**:
{List generated brief skills with keyword counts and node types}

**Example for software-development**:
- bug-brief: 50+ keywords, BugBrief node type, implementation-triad handoff
- feature-brief: 40+ keywords, FeatureBrief node type, validation-triad handoff
- refactor-brief: 35+ keywords, RefactorBrief node type, garden-tending-triad handoff

**Example for design**:
- campaign-brief: 45+ keywords, CampaignBrief node type, design-triad handoff
- brand-brief: 40+ keywords, BrandBrief node type, design-triad handoff
- ux-brief: 35+ keywords, UXBrief node type, design-triad handoff

**Evidence Quality**: All keywords derived from industry research, not speculation

    input_patterns_identified: [{vague phrases users say}]
    keywords_per_skill: "50-100+ from research"
    quality: "Research-backed, not guessed"
```

**Why this phase matters**:

Before this phase:
- ‚ùå Users must provide complete specifications upfront
- ‚ùå Vague input like "login is broken" goes nowhere
- ‚ùå No systematic way to clarify requirements
- ‚ùå Context gathering is manual and inconsistent

After this phase:
- ‚úÖ Brief skills discover vague input via keywords
- ‚úÖ Skills ask clarifying questions (AskUserQuestion)
- ‚úÖ Skills gather context (Grep, Read)
- ‚úÖ Skills create complete specifications (knowledge graph nodes)
- ‚úÖ Downstream agents get structured input

**Example workflow**:
```
User: "login is broken"
‚Üì bug-brief skill activates (keyword: "broken")
‚Üì Asks: reproduction steps, expected vs actual, error messages
‚Üì Greps codebase for login-related files
‚Üì Reads relevant files for context
‚Üì Creates BugBrief node in knowledge graph
‚Üì Returns OUTPUT envelope with node_id
‚Üì Implementation triad loads BugBrief and fixes bug
```

### Step 7: Update CLAUDE.md with @imports

**Phase**: Update CLAUDE.md (MOST CRITICAL)

**This is the highest-risk phase - proceed carefully**

#### Substep 1: Analyze Current CLAUDE.md

**Read current CLAUDE.md**:
```bash
head -50 CLAUDE.md
```

**Identify custom sections**:
```yaml
custom_sections:
  - section: "Triad Routing System"
    start_line: {{LINE}}
    end_line: {{LINE}}
    preserve: YES

  - section: "Knowledge Management"
    start_line: {{LINE}}
    end_line: {{LINE}}
    preserve: YES

  - section: "Detailed Documentation"
    start_line: {{LINE}}
    end_line: {{LINE}}
    preserve: YES
```

#### Substep 2: Read Template CLAUDE.md

**Read template**:
```bash
head -100 templates/CLAUDE.md
```

**Identify merge points**:
```yaml
merge_strategy:
  - template_section: "Constitutional Principles"
    action: "REPLACE with @imports"
    current_lines: {{START}}-{{END}}
    template_lines: {{START}}-{{END}}

  - template_section: "Triad Routing System"
    action: "PRESERVE from current"
    current_lines: {{START}}-{{END}}

  - template_section: "Knowledge Management"
    action: "PRESERVE from current"
    current_lines: {{START}}-{{END}}
```

#### Substep 3: Create Merged CLAUDE.md

**Merge strategy**:
1. Start with template structure
2. Replace inline principles with @imports
3. Add custom sections (triad routing, knowledge mgmt)
4. Preserve any project-specific content

**New CLAUDE.md structure**:
```markdown
---
# üéØ CORE OPERATING PRINCIPLES
---

## Constitutional Principles (Universal)

@.claude/constitutional/evidence-based-claims.md
@.claude/constitutional/uncertainty-escalation.md
@.claude/constitutional/multi-method-verification.md
@.claude/constitutional/complete-transparency.md
@.claude/constitutional/assumption-auditing.md
@.claude/constitutional/communication-standards.md

---

## Domain-Specific Methodology

@.claude/methodologies/software/tdd-methodology.md
@.claude/methodologies/software/code-quality-standards.md
@.claude/methodologies/software/security-protocols.md
@.claude/methodologies/software/git-workflow.md

---

## ‚ö° TRIAD ROUTING SYSTEM

[PRESERVE EXISTING CONTENT FROM CURRENT CLAUDE.md]

---

## üìä KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT

[PRESERVE EXISTING CONTENT FROM CURRENT CLAUDE.md]

---

## üìö DETAILED DOCUMENTATION

[PRESERVE EXISTING CONTENT FROM CURRENT CLAUDE.md]
```

**Action: Write new CLAUDE.md**
```bash
# Backup already done in Step 2
# Write merged content
```

**Validation**:
```bash
# Check @imports present
grep -c "@.claude/" CLAUDE.md
```
Expected: ‚â•10 @import statements

```bash
# Check custom sections preserved
grep "TRIAD ROUTING SYSTEM" CLAUDE.md
grep "KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT" CLAUDE.md
```
Expected: Both sections present

---

### Step 8: Add Memory Templates (Optional)

**Phase**: Add Memory Templates

**Action 1: Copy user memory**
```bash
cp templates/USER_MEMORY.md .claude/USER_MEMORY.md
```

**Action 2: Copy workflow memory**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/workflow-memory
cp templates/workflow-memory/*.md .claude/workflow-memory/
```

**Validation**:
```bash
ls .claude/USER_MEMORY.md
ls .claude/workflow-memory/ | wc -l
```
Expected: USER_MEMORY.md exists, 6 files in workflow-memory/

---

### Step 9: Final Validation

**Check all @imports resolve**:

```bash
# Extract @import paths from CLAUDE.md
grep "@.claude/" CLAUDE.md | sed 's/^@//'

# Check each file exists
# (validate-imports.sh script or manual check)
```

**For each @import path**:
```yaml
import_validation:
  - path: ".claude/constitutional/evidence-based-claims.md"
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    status: {{OK|MISSING}}

  - path: ".claude/methodologies/software/tdd-methodology.md"
    exists: {{YES|NO}}
    status: {{OK|MISSING}}
```

**All must be OK**, otherwise upgrade FAILED.
