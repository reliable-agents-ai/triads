# User Memory - Claude Code Configuration

**Owner**: {{USER_NAME}}
**Created**: {{CREATION_DATE}}
**Last Updated**: {{LAST_UPDATED}}
**Location**: `~/.claude/USER_MEMORY.md`

This file stores user-level preferences, context, and patterns that persist across all projects. Claude Code reads this file to understand your working style, preferences, and common patterns.

## üéØ PURPOSE

**What This File Does**:
- Stores your personal preferences for how Claude Code should work
- Captures your common patterns and workflows
- Documents your domain expertise and knowledge areas
- Defines your quality standards and expectations
- Tracks your project history and context

**What This File Does NOT Do**:
- Store project-specific information (that goes in project's CLAUDE.md)
- Store secrets or credentials (use environment variables)
- Override constitutional principles (those are absolute)

## üìã SECTION 1: USER PROFILE

### Basic Information

```yaml
user:
  name: {{USER_NAME}}
  role: {{USER_ROLE}}  # e.g., "Senior Software Engineer", "Researcher", "Content Creator"
  organization: {{ORGANIZATION}}  # Optional
  location: {{TIMEZONE}}  # e.g., "America/Los_Angeles" (for scheduling context)
  primary_domains:
    - {{DOMAIN_1}}  # e.g., "software-development"
    - {{DOMAIN_2}}  # e.g., "content-creation"
  secondary_domains:
    - {{DOMAIN_3}}  # Areas of secondary expertise
```

### Working Hours and Availability

```yaml
working_hours:
  timezone: {{TIMEZONE}}
  typical_hours:
    monday: "9:00-17:00"
    tuesday: "9:00-17:00"
    wednesday: "9:00-17:00"
    thursday: "9:00-17:00"
    friday: "9:00-17:00"
    saturday: "off"
    sunday: "off"

  notes:
    - "Prefer async communication"
    - "No interruptions during focus blocks (10:00-12:00, 14:00-16:00)"
    - "Available for urgent issues via Slack"
```

**Usage**: Claude Code can use this to understand when you're likely to be available, but this is informational only.

## üìã SECTION 2: COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES

### Response Style

```yaml
communication:
  verbosity: {{VERBOSITY_LEVEL}}  # "concise" | "moderate" | "detailed"
  # concise: Short responses, bullet points, minimal explanation
  # moderate: Balanced responses, some explanation, key details
  # detailed: Comprehensive responses, full explanations, all context

  technical_level: {{TECHNICAL_LEVEL}}  # "beginner" | "intermediate" | "expert"
  # beginner: Explain concepts, provide context, avoid jargon
  # intermediate: Assume basic knowledge, explain advanced concepts
  # expert: Assume deep knowledge, focus on nuances and edge cases

  preferred_format: {{FORMAT}}  # "markdown" | "code-first" | "visual"
  # markdown: Formatted text with headings, lists, code blocks
  # code-first: Lead with code examples, minimal text
  # visual: Diagrams, ASCII art, visual representations when possible
```

**Example - Concise + Expert**:
```markdown
‚ùå BAD (too verbose for concise+expert):
"Let me explain what a closure is. In JavaScript, a closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer scope, even after the outer function has returned. This is a powerful feature that allows for data encapsulation and functional programming patterns. Here's how it works..."

‚úÖ GOOD (concise+expert):
"Closure pattern for data encapsulation:
```javascript
const counter = (() => {
  let count = 0;
  return { inc: () => ++count, get: () => count };
})();
```
Lexical scope preserves `count` - standard closure pattern."
```

**Example - Detailed + Beginner**:
```markdown
‚ùå BAD (too concise for detailed+beginner):
"Use closure for encapsulation."

‚úÖ GOOD (detailed+beginner):
"I'll explain closures, which help keep data private.

**What is a closure?**
A closure is a function that 'remembers' variables from where it was created, even after that outer function has finished running.

**Why use closures?**
They let you create private data that can't be accessed from outside.

**Example**:
```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;  // This is private

  return {
    increment: function() { count++; },
    getValue: function() { return count; }
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.getValue());  // 1
console.log(counter.count);  // undefined (private!)
```

**What's happening**:
1. `createCounter` creates a variable `count`
2. It returns an object with two functions
3. Those functions can still access `count` even after `createCounter` finishes
4. But code outside can't access `count` directly - it's private!"
```

### Question Answering Preferences

```yaml
questions:
  ask_before_proceeding:
    - major_architectural_decisions  # Always ask before choosing architecture
    - destructive_operations  # Always ask before deleting files, dropping databases, etc.
    - external_service_calls  # Ask before calling APIs, sending emails, etc.
    - spending_resources  # Ask before operations that cost money

  proceed_without_asking:
    - minor_refactoring  # Proceed with safe refactoring (within same file)
    - formatting_changes  # Proceed with code formatting (black, prettier, etc.)
    - test_writing  # Proceed with writing tests
    - documentation_updates  # Proceed with updating docs

  uncertainty_threshold: {{THRESHOLD}}  # 90 (default) | 85 (more conservative) | 95 (less interruptions)
  # If confidence < threshold, escalate to user
```

**Example**:
```yaml
# Conservative user (prefers to be asked)
uncertainty_threshold: 95
ask_before_proceeding:
  - major_architectural_decisions
  - destructive_operations
  - external_service_calls
  - spending_resources
  - database_schema_changes
  - dependency_updates

# Autonomous user (prefers fewer interruptions)
uncertainty_threshold: 85
ask_before_proceeding:
  - destructive_operations
  - spending_resources
proceed_without_asking:
  - minor_refactoring
  - formatting_changes
  - test_writing
  - documentation_updates
  - minor_dependency_updates
```

# Constitutional principle requires 90% threshold
# User preference cannot override this
# Claude Code will still escalate at 90% threshold

## üìö INTEGRATION WITH PROJECT MEMORY

### Relationship to CLAUDE.md

```
User Memory (~/.claude/USER_MEMORY.md)
    ‚Üì
    Personal preferences, domain expertise, common patterns

Project Memory (project/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
    ‚Üì
    Project-specific context, team standards, workflow design

Constitutional Principles (.claude/constitutional/*.md)
    ‚Üì
    ABSOLUTE standards that cannot be overridden
```

**Authority Hierarchy**:
1. **Constitutional Principles**: ABSOLUTE (cannot be overridden)
2. **Project Memory**: HIGH (project-specific standards)
3. **User Memory**: MEDIUM (user preferences)
4. **Default Behavior**: LOW (Claude Code defaults)

**Example Conflict Resolution**:
```yaml
# User Memory says:
communication:
  verbosity: "concise"

# Project CLAUDE.md says:
communication:
  require_detailed_explanations: true

# RESULT: Project memory wins (higher authority)
# Claude Code provides detailed explanations for this project
# But uses concise style in other projects
```

## üí° TIPS AND BEST PRACTICES

### Start Small, Grow Incrementally

**Week 1**: Just fill in User Profile and Communication Preferences
**Week 2**: Add Technical Preferences as you discover them
**Week 3**: Add Domain Expertise
**Month 2**: Add Project Patterns and Workflows
**Month 3**: Add Learning Goals and Common Issues

### Use Comments for Context

```yaml
quality:
  test_coverage_minimum: 90  # Strict for production code
  # For experimental projects, 70% is acceptable
```

### Document Your "Why"

```yaml
tools:
  package_manager:
    python: "poetry"
    # Why: Better dependency resolution than pip
    # Why: Lock file ensures reproducible installs
    # Why: Virtual env management built-in
```

### Keep It Updated

Set a reminder:
```bash
# Add to crontab (monthly review)
0 9 1 * * echo "Review ~/.claude/USER_MEMORY.md" | mail -s "User Memory Review" you@email.com
```
