# Check Test Coverage

**Purpose**: Verify test coverage meets threshold requirements (default ‚â•80%). Ensure code is adequately tested before deployment.

**Domain**: Software Development

**Authority**: Domain-specific quality gate

---

## üìã When to Invoke

**Invoke this skill when**:
- After writing tests (test-engineer)
- Before marking implementation complete (test-engineer)
- During quality gate validation (test-engineer)
- Before deployment (release-manager)
- After refactoring (pruner - ensure tests still cover)

**Keywords that trigger this skill**:
- "check test coverage"
- "verify coverage"
- "coverage report"
- "80% coverage"
- "test completeness"
- "coverage threshold"
- "quality gate"

---

## üéØ Coverage Standards (From Methodology)

This skill enforces standards from `@.claude/methodologies/software/tdd-methodology.md` and `code-quality-standards.md`:

### Coverage Thresholds

**Minimum Requirements**:
- **Overall**: ‚â•80% line coverage
- **Critical modules**: ‚â•90% coverage
- **New code**: 100% coverage (no untested new code)

**Coverage Types**:
1. **Line Coverage**: % of lines executed
2. **Branch Coverage**: % of conditional branches taken
3. **Function Coverage**: % of functions called
4. **Statement Coverage**: % of statements executed

### What Must Be Tested

**‚úÖ Must have tests**:
- All public functions/methods
- All API endpoints
- All business logic
- Error handling paths
- Edge cases
- Security-critical code

**‚ö†Ô∏è Optional (but recommended)**:
- Private helper functions (if complex)
- Configuration loading
- Logging statements

**‚ùå Exclude from coverage**:
- `__init__.py` files (imports only)
- Migrations
- Configuration files
- Test files themselves

---

## üìã Skill Procedure

### Step 1: Identify Coverage Tool

**Determine which tool to use**:

```yaml
project_type: "{{PYTHON|JAVASCRIPT|TYPESCRIPT|GO|RUST}}"

coverage_tool:
  python: "pytest-cov or coverage.py"
  javascript: "jest --coverage or nyc"
  typescript: "jest --coverage"
  go: "go test -cover"
  rust: "cargo-tarpaulin"
```

**For this project** (Python):
```bash
# Using pytest-cov
pytest --cov=<module> --cov-report=term --cov-report=html
```

---

### Step 2: Run Coverage Analysis

#### Full Project Coverage

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html tests/

# Output shows:
# - Overall coverage %
# - Per-file coverage
# - Missing lines
```

**Expected output**:
```
---------- coverage: platform darwin, python 3.11.5 -----------
Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
-------------------------------------------------------
src/api/routes.py           45      3    93%   23-25
src/core/validator.py       30      0   100%
src/models/user.py          50      8    84%   15, 22, 45-48, 67
-------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                       125     11    91%
```

#### Module-Specific Coverage

```bash
# Check specific module
pytest --cov=src/api --cov-report=term-missing tests/test_api/
```

---

### Step 3: Analyze Coverage Report

#### Parse Coverage Data

```yaml
coverage_analysis:
  overall_coverage: {{PERCENTAGE}}%
  total_statements: {{NUMBER}}
  covered_statements: {{NUMBER}}
  missing_statements: {{NUMBER}}

  per_file:
    - file: "{{FILE_PATH}}"
      coverage: {{PERCENTAGE}}%
      statements: {{NUMBER}}
      missing: {{NUMBER}}
      missing_lines: [{{LINE_NUMBERS}}]
      status: "{{PASS|WARNING|FAIL}}"

    - file: "{{FILE_PATH_2}}"
      coverage: {{PERCENTAGE}}%
      statements: {{NUMBER}}
      missing: {{NUMBER}}
      missing_lines: [{{LINE_NUMBERS}}]
      status: "{{STATUS}}"
```

**Status determination**:
- **PASS**: Coverage ‚â•80% (or ‚â•90% for critical modules)
- **WARNING**: Coverage 70-79% (borderline, improvements recommended)
- **FAIL**: Coverage <70% (unacceptable, more tests required)

---

### Step 4: Identify Gaps

#### Critical Uncovered Code

**Flag high-priority uncovered lines**:

```yaml
coverage_gaps:
  - file: "{{FILE}}"
    function: "{{FUNCTION_NAME}}"
    lines_missing: [{{LINES}}]
    priority: "{{CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW}}"
    reason: "{{WHY_CRITICAL}}"
    test_needed: "{{TEST_DESCRIPTION}}"
```

**Priority criteria**:
- **CRITICAL**: Security-sensitive code, error handling, authentication
- **HIGH**: Business logic, API endpoints, data validation
- **MEDIUM**: Helper functions, utilities
- **LOW**: Configuration, logging, trivial getters/setters

**Example**:
```yaml
coverage_gaps:
  - file: "src/api/routes.py"
    function: "authenticate_user"
    lines_missing: [23-25]
    priority: "CRITICAL"
    reason: "Authentication logic must be fully tested"
    test_needed: "Test invalid credentials handling"

  - file: "src/models/user.py"
    function: "validate_email"
    lines_missing: [45-48]
    priority: "HIGH"
    reason: "Email validation is business logic"
    test_needed: "Test edge cases: empty email, invalid format, SQL injection attempt"
```

---

### Step 5: Check Branch Coverage

**Branch coverage** shows if all conditional paths tested:

```bash
# Check branch coverage (if supported)
pytest --cov=src --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Analyze conditionals**:
```yaml
branch_coverage:
  - file: "{{FILE}}"
    line: {{LINE_NUMBER}}
    condition: "{{CODE}}"
    branches_total: {{NUMBER}}
    branches_covered: {{NUMBER}}
    uncovered_paths:
      - "{{PATH_DESCRIPTION}}"
```

**Example**:
```yaml
branch_coverage:
  - file: "src/core/validator.py"
    line: 15
    condition: "if user.is_admin or user.has_permission('edit'):"
    branches_total: 4  # True/True, True/False, False/True, False/False
    branches_covered: 2
    uncovered_paths:
      - "user.is_admin=False and user.has_permission=True"
      - "Both conditions False"
```

---

### Step 6: Validate Against Threshold

**Check if coverage meets requirements**:

```yaml
threshold_validation:
  required_coverage: {{THRESHOLD}}%  # Default 80%
  actual_coverage: {{ACTUAL}}%
  meets_threshold: "{{YES|NO}}"

  per_module_thresholds:
    - module: "{{MODULE}}"
      required: {{PERCENTAGE}}%  # Critical modules may require 90%
      actual: {{PERCENTAGE}}%
      meets_threshold: "{{YES|NO}}"
```

**Result**:
- ‚úÖ **PASS**: All thresholds met
- ‚ùå **FAIL**: One or more thresholds not met

---

### Step 7: Generate Coverage Report

```markdown
## Test Coverage Report

**Project**: {{PROJECT_NAME}}
**Timestamp**: {{TIMESTAMP}}
**Coverage Tool**: {{TOOL}}

---

### Overall Coverage

**Total**: {{PERCENTAGE}}% ({{COVERED}}/{{TOTAL}} statements)

**Threshold**: {{THRESHOLD}}%
**Status**: {{‚úÖ PASS | ‚ùå FAIL}}

---

### Per-File Coverage

| File | Coverage | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| {{FILE_1}} | {{PERCENTAGE}}% | {{‚úÖ|‚ö†Ô∏è|‚ùå}} |
| {{FILE_2}} | {{PERCENTAGE}}% | {{‚úÖ|‚ö†Ô∏è|‚ùå}} |

---

### Coverage Gaps

{{#if gaps}}
**Critical Gaps** ({{COUNT}}):
{{CRITICAL_GAPS_LIST}}

**High Priority Gaps** ({{COUNT}}):
{{HIGH_PRIORITY_GAPS_LIST}}

**Medium Priority Gaps** ({{COUNT}}):
{{MEDIUM_PRIORITY_GAPS_LIST}}
{{/if}}

{{#if no_gaps}}
‚úÖ No significant coverage gaps found
{{/if}}

---

### Branch Coverage

**Branch Coverage**: {{PERCENTAGE}}%

{{#if uncovered_branches}}
**Uncovered Branches** ({{COUNT}}):
{{UNCOVERED_BRANCHES_LIST}}
{{/if}}

---

### Recommendations

{{#if pass}}
‚úÖ **Coverage meets standards**

No action required. Continue maintaining high test coverage.
{{/if}}

{{#if fail}}
‚ùå **Coverage below threshold**

**Required actions**:
1. {{ACTION_1}}
2. {{ACTION_2}}

**Tests to write**:
{{TESTS_NEEDED_LIST}}

**Cannot proceed to deployment until coverage ‚â•{{THRESHOLD}}%**
{{/if}}

{{#if warning}}
‚ö†Ô∏è **Coverage acceptable but borderline**

**Recommended improvements**:
{{IMPROVEMENT_LIST}}
{{/if}}

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: After Writing Tests

**test-engineer**:
```
I've written tests for the new authentication module. Checking coverage...

Using check-test-coverage skill...

Result:
- Overall: 92% ‚úÖ
- src/auth/login.py: 95%
- src/auth/validate.py: 88%

Exceeds 80% threshold. Ready for implementation complete.
```

### Example 2: Coverage Below Threshold

**test-engineer**:
```
Checking coverage after implementation...

Using check-test-coverage skill...

Result:
- Overall: 72% ‚ùå
- src/api/routes.py: 65% (15 lines uncovered)

FAIL: Below 80% threshold.

Critical gaps:
- authenticate_user() function (lines 23-25) - NO TESTS
- validate_input() error handling (lines 45-48) - NOT COVERED

Required: Write tests for critical authentication and validation paths.
Cannot proceed to deployment.
```

### Example 3: After Refactoring

**pruner**:
```
Refactored UserManager class. Verifying tests still cover code...

Using check-test-coverage skill...

Result:
- Overall: 89% ‚úÖ (was 87% before refactoring)
- src/models/user.py: 89%

Coverage maintained after refactoring. Tests still comprehensive.
```
