# Release Coordination Skill

**Purpose**: Orchestrate complete release workflow from user request → brief → routing → triad execution.

---

## Skill Procedure

### Phase 1: CREATE BRIEF

**Objective**: Transform user request into structured ReleaseBrief.

**Action**:
Use Task tool to invoke brief skill:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="skill:generic-brief",
  description="Create release brief",
  prompt="""
  {{user_message}}
  """
)
```

**Capture**: Brief node ID from skill output (format: `release_brief_*`)

**If Brief Fails**: Ask user for more details about the release.

---

### Phase 2: ROUTE TO TRIAD

**Objective**: Determine target triad and entry agent from routing table.

**Action**:
Read routing decision table:

```
Read(file_path=".claude/routing_decision_table.yaml")
```

**Extract**:
- `target_triad`: deployment
- `entry_agent`: gardener-bridge
- `confidence`: 0.85

**If Ambiguous** (confidence < 0.70): Ask user to clarify work type.

---

### Phase 3: INVOKE TRIAD

**Objective**: Hand off to deployment triad via gardener-bridge entry agent.

**Action**:
Use Task tool to invoke entry agent:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="agent:deployment:gardener-bridge",
  description="Release execution",
  prompt="""
  HANDOFF FROM COORDINATION

  Work Type: release
  Brief Node: {{brief_node_id}}
  Original Request: {{user_message}}

  Please proceed with release workflow as specified in brief.
  Triad: deployment
  Entry Point: gardener-bridge

  Constitutional Requirements:
  - Follow TDD cycle (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR) if code changes
  - Maintain ≥80% test coverage
  - Document all assumptions
  - Triple-verify before completion
  """
)
```

**Monitor**: Track triad execution through knowledge graph updates.

**If Invocation Fails**: Provide fallback options or escalate to user.

---

### Phase 4: MONITOR EXECUTION

**Objective**: Track triad progress and report completion.

**Actions**:
1. Monitor knowledge graph for triad progress nodes
2. Check for completion signal from triad
3. Verify output confidence ≥ 0.85
4. Report status to user

**If Low Confidence** (< 0.85): Explain uncertainty and suggest follow-up actions.

---

## Error Handling

### Phase 1 Errors (Brief Creation)
- **Symptom**: Brief skill fails or returns error
- **Response**: Ask user for more details about the release
- **Example**: "Could you provide more details about [what's unclear]?"

### Phase 2 Errors (Routing Ambiguity)
- **Symptom**: Multiple work types match with similar confidence
- **Response**: Ask user to clarify work type
- **Example**: "This could be a release or [other type]. Which is it?"

### Phase 3 Errors (Triad Invocation)
- **Symptom**: Entry agent not available or triad fails to start
- **Response**: Provide fallback options
- **Example**: "Could not route to deployment. Try [fallback] instead?"

### Phase 4 Errors (Low Confidence)
- **Symptom**: Result confidence < 0.85
- **Response**: Explain uncertainty to user
- **Example**: "Completed with 75% confidence due to [reason]. Review recommended."

## Examples

### Example 1: Software Development
**User Input**: "Login is broken, users can't sign in"

**Phase 1**: Creates BugBrief with issue details
**Phase 2**: Routes to implementation triad (confidence: 0.95)
**Phase 3**: Invokes senior-developer agent
**Phase 4**: Monitors fix implementation and testing

### Example 2: Research Domain
**User Input**: "Study correlation between X and Y"

**Phase 1**: Creates ResearchBrief with study parameters
**Phase 2**: Routes to research triad (confidence: 0.90)
**Phase 3**: Invokes research-lead agent
**Phase 4**: Monitors literature review and analysis

---

## Constitutional Compliance

This coordination skill follows constitutional principles:
- **Evidence-Based**: All routing decisions backed by confidence scores
- **Transparency**: Complete workflow visibility through 4 phases
- **Uncertainty Escalation**: Escalates when confidence < 0.70
- **Multi-Method Verification**: Routing table + brief validation + triad execution
