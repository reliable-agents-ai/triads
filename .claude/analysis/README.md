## üéØ What Can Be Deleted

| Module | LOC | When | Risk | Status |
|--------|-----|------|------|--------|
| generator/ | 0 | NOW | ZERO | ‚úÖ Script ready |
| km/graph_access/ | 907 | After migration | LOW | üîç 2 imports to migrate |
| workflow_enforcement/ (8 files) | 2,051 | NOW | LOW | ‚úÖ Verified safe |
| workflow_matching/ | 1,800 | v0.11.0 | MEDIUM | ‚è∞ Wait for deprecation |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What CANNOT Be Deleted

| Module | LOC | Reason |
|--------|-----|--------|
| router/ | 2,799 | Different system (CLI vs MCP) |
| km/ (most files) | 3,409 | Active imports from hooks |
| workflow_enforcement/ (4 files) | 3,449 | Active imports (instance_manager, etc.) |

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Just Delete Empty Generator
```bash
cd /Users/iainnb/Documents/repos/triads
bash .claude/analysis/SAFE_DELETION_SCRIPT.sh
```

### Option 2: Full Cleanup (Safe)
```bash
# Step 1: Delete generator
bash .claude/analysis/SAFE_DELETION_SCRIPT.sh

# Step 2: Migrate km/ imports (manual - see VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md)
# Edit: src/triads/km/experience_query.py
# Edit: src/triads/km/commands.py
# Then: rm -rf src/triads/km/graph_access/

# Step 3: Delete workflow_enforcement refactored files
# See VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md for deletion script

# Step 4: Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

### Option 3: Read First, Decide Later
```bash
# Read executive summary
cat .claude/analysis/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md

# Read detailed analysis
cat .claude/analysis/module_deletion_analysis.md

# Review verification checklist
cat .claude/analysis/VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md
```

## üîë Key Findings

### 1. Router is NOT Redundant ‚ö†Ô∏è
- `src/triads/router/` = OLD CLI system
- `tools/router/` = NEW MCP tools
- **Different purposes, both needed**

### 2. km/ is Mostly Active üü¢
- Most files used by hooks system
- Only `graph_access/` subdirectory refactored
- **Don't be fooled by size**

### 3. Verification Critical ‚úÖ
- `verify_workflow_enforcement.sh` passed
- 8 files safe to delete
- **Always verify before deleting**

### 4. Shims Have Purpose ‚è∞
- `workflow_matching/` and `workflow_enforcement/__init__.py`
- Provide backward compatibility
- **Respect deprecation periods**

## üìã Next Actions

**Immediate** (you choose):
- [ ] Run `SAFE_DELETION_SCRIPT.sh` (delete empty generator/)
- [ ] Review EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Decide on router split strategy

**Short-term** (if you approve):
- [ ] Migrate km/ imports (2 files)
- [ ] Delete km/graph_access/
- [ ] Delete workflow_enforcement refactored files (8 files)
- [ ] Update documentation

**Medium-term** (v0.11.0):
- [ ] Delete workflow_matching/ shim
- [ ] Update migration guide

---

## ü§î Questions to Answer

1. **Router split**: Document as intentional or plan convergence?
2. **km/ migration**: Proceed with import migration?
3. **workflow_enforcement/ deletion**: Create and run deletion script?
4. **Documentation updates**: Which docs to update first?

---

## üìä Impact Summary

### Lines Deleted (After All Steps)
- Immediate: 0 LOC (generator empty)
- Short-term: 2,958 LOC (21%)
- Medium-term: 1,800 LOC (12%)
- **Total: 4,758 LOC (33%)**

### Lines Kept (Active)
- **Total: 9,657 LOC (67%)**

### Test Preservation
- Baseline: 1,553+ tests
- After cleanup: 1,553+ tests (maintained)

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Not all old code is redundant** - Router is a different system
2. **Size doesn't indicate redundancy** - km/ is mostly active
3. **Verification saves time** - Found exactly what's safe to delete
4. **Backward compatibility matters** - Shims serve a purpose

---

## üìû Support

If you need clarification:
1. Read EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (high-level)
2. Read module_deletion_analysis.md (detailed)
3. Check VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md (step-by-step)
4. Run verification scripts (automated checks)

All scripts have safety checks and will abort if anything is wrong.
