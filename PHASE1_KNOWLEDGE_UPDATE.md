## Implementation Decision: Regex-Based Parsing

[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: impl_decision_regex_parsing
node_type: Decision
label: Use Regex for Agent Output Parsing
description: Decided to use regex patterns for parsing agent output markers instead of more complex parsers
confidence: 0.95
alternatives:
  - "Full markdown parser - Rejected: Too heavy, overkill for simple markers"
  - "Custom state machine - Rejected: More complex to maintain"
  - "Regex patterns - Chosen: Simple, fast, handles edge cases well"
rationale: |
  Agent output has well-defined marker syntax ([GRAPH_UPDATE], [AGENT_CONTEXT], etc.).
  Regex provides sufficient power for this structured format while remaining simple.
  Python's re module is battle-tested and handles edge cases (nested content, special chars, unicode).
evidence:
  - 43 tests pass including edge cases (malformed blocks, special characters, unicode)
  - 84% coverage on context_passing.py
  - Performance is excellent (< 1ms for typical agent outputs)
trade_offs:
  - Pro: Simple, fast, well-understood
  - Pro: Easy to debug and modify patterns
  - Con: Not as robust as full parser for complex nested structures
  - Con: Patterns can become complex for very intricate formats
mitigation: Comprehensive test suite covers edge cases, error handling returns sensible defaults

## Implementation Decision: Extract-Then-Format Pattern

[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: impl_decision_extract_format_pattern
node_type: Decision
label: Separate Extraction from Formatting
description: Split context passing into extract functions and format function rather than single monolithic function
confidence: 1.0
alternatives:
  - "Single format_context() function - Rejected: Hard to test, low reusability"
  - "Separate extract and format - Chosen: Composable, testable, flexible"
rationale: |
  Separation of concerns: extraction logic is independent from formatting logic.
  Allows callers to extract once and format multiple times if needed.
  Makes testing easier (can test extraction and formatting separately).
  Follows Unix philosophy: do one thing well.
evidence:
  - Tests are cleaner and more focused
  - format_agent_context() accepts pre-extracted data (optional parameters)
  - Orchestrator can extract once and decide whether to format based on logic
pattern: Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)
benefits:
  - Composability: Can use extractors independently
  - Testability: Unit test each function in isolation
  - Flexibility: Can add new extractors without changing format logic
  - Performance: Can cache extracted data

## Implementation: Test Suite

[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: impl_phase1_test_suite
node_type: Entity
label: Phase 1 Test Suite
description: Comprehensive test coverage for context passing and orchestrator instruction generation
confidence: 1.0
test_files:
  - tests/test_context_passing.py: 43 tests, 84% coverage
  - tests/test_orchestrator_instructions.py: 20 tests, 100% coverage
total_tests: 63
all_passing: true
test_categories:
  - Unit tests: Extract functions, format functions, detection functions
  - Integration tests: Full workflows (extract → format → detect HITL)
  - Edge cases: Empty inputs, malformed data, special characters, unicode
  - Security tests: Path traversal handled by validation (inherited pattern)
test_patterns_followed:
  - Pytest fixtures for setup (temp_workspace pattern from existing tests)
  - Google-style docstrings on all test functions
  - Descriptive test names following test_{function}_{scenario} pattern
  - Comprehensive edge case coverage
  - Integration tests for complete workflows

## Bugfix: Agent Template Syntax Error

[GRAPH_UPDATE]
type: add_node
node_id: bugfix_agent_template_apostrophe
node_type: Finding
label: Fixed Syntax Error in Agent Template
description: Fixed unterminated string literal in agent_templates.py line 296 caused by apostrophe in f-string
confidence: 1.0
file_path: src/triads/templates/agent_templates.py
line: 296
issue: Apostrophe in "I've" broke f-string parsing
fix: Changed "I've" to "I have"
impact: Prevented all tests from running due to import error
resolution_time: Immediate (1 commit)

## Knowledge Applied from Graph

During implementation, the following knowledge from implementation_graph.json was applied:

**Decisions Applied:**
- Timezone-aware datetimes: Not applicable (no timestamps in Phase 1)
- State file locking (fcntl.flock): Not applicable (no file writes in Phase 1)
- Instance-based architecture: Pattern observed, not modified
- Graceful degradation: Applied in error handling (returns sensible defaults)

**Patterns Applied:**
- Pytest fixtures for test setup (temp_workspace pattern)
- Google-style docstrings consistently used
- Type hints on all functions
- Security validation patterns (inherited from existing code)
- Test-driven development approach (tests written during implementation)

**Test Patterns Observed:**
- test_{function}_{scenario} naming convention
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Integration tests for workflows
- Mock fixtures for configuration files

**End of Phase 1 Knowledge Updates**

Ready for handoff to test-engineer for integration testing (Phase 2).
