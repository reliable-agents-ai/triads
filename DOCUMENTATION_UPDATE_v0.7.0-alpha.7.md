## Release Highlights for User Communication

### Elevator Pitch

> **v0.7.0-alpha.7** enables you to work on multiple features concurrently while fixing critical security vulnerabilities. Track OAuth2 integration, notification system design, and search feature validation simultaneouslyâ€”each with automatic progress tracking and session continuity.

### Key Messages

**1. Multi-Instance Workflows**
- Work on multiple features at once without confusion
- Each workflow tracked separately with unique instance IDs
- Resume any workflow at session start

**2. Critical Security Fixes**
- Path traversal vulnerability eliminated (CVE-eligible severity)
- Race condition fixed (100% stable under concurrent access)
- **Recommendation**: Upgrade immediately for production use

**3. Developer Experience**
- `/workflows list` - See all active workflows
- `/workflows resume <id>` - Jump back into any workflow
- `/workflows show <id>` - View detailed progress
- Automatic workflow creation when starting triads

**4. Quality Improvements**
- Test coverage: 18% â†’ 74% (+56 points)
- Code health: 6.5/10 â†’ 8.5/10 (+2.0)
- 17/17 tests passing (100%)

## What Was NOT Changed (Intentionally)

### CHANGELOG.md Historical Entries

**Preserved**:
- All entries for v0.7.0-alpha.[1-6] remain unchanged
- Historical version references are correct (e.g., "in v0.7.0-alpha.2")
- Deprecation notices preserved as written

**Reasoning**: CHANGELOG is historical record, should not be retroactively modified

### Code Files

**Not Modified**:
- No Python source code changed
- No test files modified
- No configuration files changed (except marketplace.json version bump, already done by release manager)

**Reasoning**: Documentation Updater role is documentation only

### Installation Scripts

**Not Modified**:
- install-triads.sh
- setup-complete.sh
- quick-install.sh

**Reasoning**: Installation instructions reference "latest" release, no version-specific changes needed

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Comprehensive Guide**: 679-line WORKFLOW_MANAGEMENT.md covers everything users need
2. **Security Transparency**: Clear disclosure of CVE-eligible vulnerability
3. **Link Verification**: All 18 links verified before commit
4. **User-Focused**: Examples use realistic multi-feature scenarios

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Visual Diagrams**: Text-based diagrams are functional but could be enhanced with images
