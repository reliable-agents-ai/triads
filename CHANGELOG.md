## [0.8.0-alpha.2] - 2025-10-20

### Fixed
- Version bump to address potential plugin caching issues
- Ensures users receive the latest Supervisor-first architecture implementation

**Note**: This is a republish of v0.8.0-alpha.1 with a version increment to bypass any marketplace caching. All features and functionality are identical to v0.8.0-alpha.1.

## [0.8.0-alpha.1] - 2025-10-20

### üéØ Major: Supervisor-First Architecture (Phase 1)

**Breaking Change**: ALL user interactions now route through the Supervisor Agent. This fundamentally changes how you interact with the triads system.

#### New Architecture

- **Supervisor Agent** - Primary interface for all user interactions (`.claude/agents/supervisor/supervisor.md`)
  - Automatically triages Q&A vs. work requests
  - Classifies problem types: bug, feature, performance, refactoring, investigation, deployment
  - Routes to appropriate workflows with user confirmation (training mode)
  - Enforces triad atomicity (ADR-006 - triads are never decomposed)

- **UserPromptSubmit Hook** - Supervisor instructions injected on every user message
  - Implemented in `hooks/user_prompt_submit.py`
  - Registered in `hooks/hooks.json`
  - Fires before Claude sees your message
  - Provides intelligent triage and routing

#### Key Features (Phase 1)

1. **Intelligent Triage**
   - Q&A indicators: "What is...", "How does...", "Explain..."
   - Work indicators: "Implement...", "Fix this bug...", "Optimize..."
   - Answers Q&A directly, routes work to appropriate workflows

2. **Problem Classification** (6 types)
   - **Bug**: Error, crash, broken, not working ‚Üí Investigation ‚Üí Fixing ‚Üí Verification (3 triads)
   - **Performance**: Slow, optimize, speed up ‚Üí Profiling ‚Üí Optimization ‚Üí Benchmarking (3 triads)
   - **Feature**: Add, implement, new ‚Üí Idea Validation ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Garden Tending ‚Üí Deployment (5 triads)
   - **Refactoring**: Cleanup, consolidate, simplify ‚Üí Garden Tending (1-2 triads)
   - **Investigation**: Analyze, research, understand ‚Üí Discovery ‚Üí Analysis (2 triads)
   - **Deployment**: Release, deploy, publish ‚Üí Garden Tending ‚Üí Deployment (2 triads)

3. **Training Mode** (Always Active in Phase 1)
   - Shows confidence score for classification
   - Explains reasoning for workflow suggestion
   - Asks for user confirmation before routing
   - Example: "This appears to be a **bug fix** (confidence: 0.95). Would you like me to start Bug Investigation workflow?"

4. **Emergency Bypass**
   - Prefix message with `/direct` to skip Supervisor
   - Returns to normal conversational mode
   - Use when you need direct Claude interaction
   - Example: `/direct Just show me the file contents`

5. **Triad Atomicity Enforcement** (ADR-006)
   - Triads are atomic units (like military fire teams)
   - Cannot extract individual agents from triads
   - Workflows compose intact triads, never decompose them
   - Based on military organizational doctrine

#### Architecture Decision Records

- **ADR-007: Supervisor-First Multi-Workflow Architecture** (`docs/adrs/ADR-SUPERVISOR-ARCHITECTURE.md`)
  - Decision: ALL user interactions route through Supervisor (not optional)
  - Rationale: Systematic problem classification, learning from outcomes, consistent UX
  - Rejected alternatives: Gradual migration, optional mode, decomposable triads

#### Implementation Details

**New Modules**:
- `src/triads/supervisor/core.py` - Core supervisor logic (87% test coverage)
- `src/triads/supervisor/__init__.py` - Module initialization

**New Tests**:
- `tests/supervisor/test_supervisor_core.py` - 8 core logic tests
- `tests/supervisor/test_user_prompt_submit_hook.py` - 7 hook integration tests
- **Total**: 15/15 tests passing (100% pass rate)

**Documentation**:
- `docs/SUPERVISOR_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive testing guide with 7 test scenarios
- `docs/MILITARY_ORGANIZATIONAL_PATTERNS.md` - Theoretical background (military organizational patterns)
- Updated agent definition with triage logic and classification guidelines

#### How to Use

**After updating, restart Claude Code** to activate the Supervisor hook.

**Test Scenarios**:

1. **Ask a question** (Q&A, no routing):
   ```
   What is the Supervisor agent?
   ```
   Expected: Direct answer, no workflow routing

2. **Report a bug** (work, routing with confirmation):
   ```
   There's a bug where the hook doesn't load on session start
   ```
   Expected: Classifies as "bug", suggests workflow, asks for confirmation

3. **Request a feature** (work, routing with confirmation):
   ```
   Let's add support for parallel workflow execution
   ```
   Expected: Classifies as "feature", suggests Idea Validation or Design, asks confirmation

4. **Use emergency bypass**:
   ```
   /direct Just show me the contents of hooks/hooks.json
   ```
   Expected: Skips Supervisor, direct conversational response

#### What's NOT in Phase 1

‚è≥ **Future Phases**:
- Phase 2: Workflow library (proven workflows for common problems)
- Phase 3: Automated classification with semantic routing
- Phase 4: Execution monitoring and progress tracking
- Phase 5: Learning system (improves from outcomes)

Phase 1 provides the foundation with manual classification and training mode confirmations.

#### Migration Notes

**Breaking Change**: Interaction model fundamentally changed

**Before v0.8**:
- Conversational sessions with main Claude
- Manual workflow invocation (e.g., "Start Garden Tending: ...")
- No systematic problem classification

**After v0.8**:
- ALL input routes through Supervisor
- Automatic triage (Q&A vs. work)
- Systematic problem classification
- Workflow suggestions with confirmation

**How to Adapt**:
1. **Q&A works the same** - Ask questions normally, get direct answers
2. **Work requests are triaged** - Supervisor classifies and suggests workflows
3. **Training mode active** - You'll be asked to confirm routing (for now)
4. **Use `/direct` if needed** - Skip Supervisor for direct conversation

**No data loss**: Existing workflows, knowledge graphs, and configuration unchanged.

#### Performance Impact

**Minimal**: Hook adds ~50ms per message (supervisor instructions injection)

**Test Results**:
- Hook execution: <100ms
- No impact on Claude response time
- No impact on existing functionality

#### Known Limitations (Phase 1)

1. **Manual Classification** - Supervisor provides guidelines, not automated routing (Phase 3)
2. **No Workflow Library** - Falls back to existing triad commands (Phase 2)
3. **No Execution Monitoring** - Can't track workflow progress automatically (Phase 4)
4. **No Learning** - Doesn't improve from outcomes yet (Phase 5)
5. **Training Mode Always On** - Always asks for confirmation (will graduate in later phases)

#### Troubleshooting

**If Supervisor not active**:
1. Restart Claude Code completely
2. Check `hooks/hooks.json` has UserPromptSubmit hook
3. Test hook: `python3 hooks/user_prompt_submit.py`
4. Look for "üéØ SUPERVISOR MODE: ACTIVE" in session context

**If you need to disable**:
- Use `/direct` prefix for individual messages
- Or temporarily comment out UserPromptSubmit in `hooks/hooks.json`

See `docs/SUPERVISOR_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for complete testing scenarios and debugging.

## [0.7.0-alpha.7] - 2025-10-20

### Security (CRITICAL FIXES)

- **Fixed path traversal vulnerability in workflow context utilities** (CVE-eligible severity)
  - Added comprehensive input validation for workflow instance IDs in `src/triads/utils/workflow_context.py`
  - Environment variable `TRIADS_WORKFLOW_INSTANCE` now validated against path traversal patterns
  - Prevents malicious instance IDs like `../../../etc/passwd` from accessing arbitrary files
  - Validation pattern: alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores only, max 255 characters
  - Graceful degradation: invalid IDs logged as warnings and ignored

### Reliability (CRITICAL FIXES)

- **Fixed race condition in concurrent workflow file access**
  - Replaced plain file I/O with atomic operations using file locking
  - `atomic_read_json()` and `atomic_write_json()` prevent corruption under concurrent access
  - Tested with 5 concurrent threads - 100% stable operations
  - Affects `current_instance.json` and workflow instance state files
  - Ensures multi-agent workflow operations are reliable

### Changed
- **Refactored Workflow Continuity to Multi-Instance Architecture** - Session start hook now uses `WorkflowInstanceManager` instead of `WorkflowStateManager`
  - Supports multiple concurrent workflow instances (e.g., OAuth2 in Implementation, Notifications in Design)
  - Displays workflow index showing ALL active workflows with instance IDs, titles, current phase, and age
  - Each workflow tracked separately in `.claude/workflows/instances/{instance-id}.json`
  - Backwards compatible with existing workflow enforcement infrastructure

### Added
- **Workflow Index Display** - Shows all active workflow instances at session start
  - Lists instance ID, title, current triad, and age (days/hours/minutes since start)
  - Prompts user with `/workflows resume <instance-id>` and `/workflows list` commands
  - Age calculation with human-friendly formatting (e.g., "2d", "3h", "45m")
- **Bridge Agent Workflow Tracking** - Design-Bridge and Gardener-Bridge now track triad completion
  - Agents call `WorkflowInstanceManager.mark_triad_completed()` after successful completion
  - Updates significance metrics with triad-specific data (tasks created, tests passing, etc.)
  - Enables workflow enforcement to verify Garden Tending completion before deployment
- **Slash Command Documentation**
  - Added `.claude/commands/workflows-list.md` - List all workflow instances
  - Added `.claude/commands/workflows-resume.md` - Resume specific workflow instance

### Testing
- Added 7 comprehensive security and concurrency tests in `tests/test_workflow_context.py`
  - Path traversal attack prevention (3 tests)
  - Invalid character rejection (2 tests)
  - Concurrent access stability (2 tests)
- All 17 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- Test coverage improved from 18% to 74% (+56 percentage points)

### Removed
- **Single-workflow limitation** - No longer restricted to tracking one workflow at a time
- Removed unused `get_next_phase()` helper function (no longer needed for multi-instance architecture)

### Technical Details
- Integrates with existing `WorkflowInstanceManager` (src/triads/workflow_enforcement/instance_manager.py)
- Functions refactored: `load_workflow_state()` ‚Üí `load_active_workflows()`, `format_workflow_resumption()` ‚Üí `format_workflow_index()`
- Uses `list_instances(status="in_progress")` to fetch all active workflows
- Instance format: `{slug}-{timestamp}-{microseconds}.json` (e.g., "oauth2-integration-20251017-100523-123456.json")
- Graceful degradation if instance manager unavailable
- Generator template (`agent_templates.py`) updated to include workflow instance management code

### Impact
- **Enables real-world multi-feature development** - Users can work on multiple features concurrently without workflow state conflicts
- **Production-hardened security** - Path traversal vulnerability eliminated before wider distribution
- **Eliminates race conditions** - Concurrent workflows stable under load
- Prepares foundation for `/workflows list` and `/workflows resume` commands
- More accurate reflection of actual development workflows (multiple parallel workstreams)

### Quality Improvements
- Code health score improved: 6.5/10 ‚Üí 8.5/10 (+2.0)
- Security vulnerabilities reduced: 2 critical ‚Üí 0 (100% elimination)
- Test coverage: 18% ‚Üí 74% (+56 points)

## [0.7.0-alpha.6] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Workflow Continuity System** - Session start hook now connects to existing workflow enforcement infrastructure
  - Auto-detects in-progress work from `.claude/workflow_state.json`
  - Prompts user to resume work in current phase or advance to next phase
  - Shows completed phases and next phase in sequence
  - Displays metadata (files changed, lines changed) when available
  - Provides clear options: continue current phase, move forward, or start new work

### Changed
- **SessionStart Hook Enhanced** - Now loads workflow state and generates resumption prompts
  - Added `load_workflow_state()` function to check for active workflows
  - Added `get_next_phase()` to determine triad sequence progression
  - Added `format_workflow_resumption()` to generate user-friendly prompts
  - Workflow continuity section appears FIRST in session start context (before routing directives)

### Fixed
- **Core Design Flaw Resolved** - Workflow enforcement infrastructure now actually connected to user-facing hooks
  - Previous implementation had WorkflowStateManager and enforcement but session_start didn't use it
  - Users no longer need to manually remember what phase they're in
  - System now proactively suggests workflow continuation
  - Addresses fundamental issue where triads were opt-in instead of default workflow

### Technical Details
- Integrates with existing `WorkflowStateManager` (src/triads/workflow_enforcement/state_manager.py)
- Compatible with existing bridge agents that call `mark_completed()`
- Graceful degradation if workflow state unavailable (hooks don't fail)
- Phase sequence: idea-validation ‚Üí design ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí garden-tending ‚Üí deployment

### Impact
- **Solves "users must prompt triads manually" problem**
- Transforms triads from suggestive framework to enforced workflow
- Maintains context across sessions via persistent state
- Makes systematic work the default path (not Q&A)

## [0.7.0-alpha.5] - 2025-10-20

### Added
- **Unified Dual-Mode Experience Injection Hook** - Intelligent escalation from silent to blocking based on knowledge criticality
  - BLOCK mode (exit 2 + stderr): User-style interjections for CRITICAL knowledge in high-stakes contexts
  - INJECT mode (exit 0 + JSON): Non-blocking `additionalContext` for helpful but non-critical knowledge
  - User-style formatting: Natural language reminders instead of error messages ("Hold on - before you...")
  - Smart blocking criteria: CRITICAL + confidence ‚â• 0.85 + risky tool + high-stakes context (version files, etc.)
  - Configuration via environment variables: `TRIADS_NO_BLOCK`, `TRIADS_NO_EXPERIENCE`, `TRIADS_BLOCK_THRESHOLD`

### Changed
- **PreToolUse Hook Reimplemented** - Merged v1 (silent) and v2 (blocking) approaches into unified dual-mode system
  - Blocks only for high-confidence CRITICAL knowledge in proven-risk contexts (version files + checklists)
  - Non-blocking injection for all other helpful knowledge
  - Never blocks read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob)
  - Maintains < 100ms performance target (core logic)

### Fixed
- **Experience Warnings Now Reach Claude** - Solved critical issue where PreToolUse stdout wasn't visible to Claude
  - Exit code 2 + stderr ensures blocking messages reach Claude's context
  - additionalContext JSON field ensures non-blocking context is available
  - 208+ previously silent injections will now be effective

### Technical Details
- Implemented according to 5 ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- 40/41 tests passing (97.6% pass rate - 2 performance tests marginally over target due to subprocess overhead)
- Backward compatible with existing knowledge graphs
- Phase 1 complete (env var config); Phase 2 (project config files) planned

### Testing
- All unit tests passing (test_dual_mode_hook.py, test_pre_tool_use_hook.py)

  - **Core Modules** (8 modules, 2,365 lines production code):
    - `schema_loader.py` - Load workflow.json with validation and query interface
    - `instance_manager.py` - Manage individual workflow instances with file locking
    - `triad_discovery.py` - Dynamically discover triads from `.claude/agents/` directory
    - `metrics/` - Pluggable metrics framework with CodeMetricsProvider (git-based)
    - `validator.py` - Schema-driven validation (no hardcoded triad names)

    - `/workflows list [--status STATUS]` - List all instances with filtering and pagination
    - `/workflows show <instance-id>` - Display detailed instance information
    - `/workflows resume <instance-id>` - Get workflow resume guidance with next step suggestions
    - `/workflows history <instance-id>` - Show deviation history and chronological analytics
    - `/workflows abandon <instance-id> --reason "..."` - Mark instance as abandoned with tracking
    - `/workflows analyze` - Cross-instance deviation pattern analysis with recommendations

    - Intelligent triad type inference (research/planning/execution/quality/release)
    - Sensible defaults for new workflows
    - Customization guidance and examples
    - CLI interface: `python scripts/generate_workflow_schema.py`

  - **Three Enforcement Modes**:
    - **Strict Mode**: Hard blocks deviations, requires emergency override with justification
    - **Recommended Mode** (DEFAULT): Warns about deviations, allows skip with documented reason
    - **Optional Mode**: Logs deviations silently, minimal friction for experimental work

  - **Instance-Based Architecture**:
    - Individual JSON files per workflow instance (`.claude/workflows/instances/`)
    - Complete workflow history and deviation tracking
    - Concurrent-safe operations with fcntl file locking
    - Lifecycle: instances/ ‚Üí completed/ or abandoned/

    - Works with software development, RFP writing, content creation, legal documents, etc.
    - Generic metrics: "content created" not "lines of code"
    - Configurable significance thresholds per domain
    - Schema-driven rules, no hardcoded workflow assumptions

### Improved

- **Code Quality** (Garden Tending Phase 1 & 2):
  - Consolidated git command execution into `git_utils.py` (~70 lines duplication removed)

  - Deprecated `enforcement.py` (single mode) in favor of `enforcement_new.py` (three modes)
  - Created migration guide: `docs/MIGRATION_v1.0.md`
  - Deprecation warnings added with stacklevel for clarity

### Security

- **Multi-Layer Validation**:

### What to Test (Alpha Testers)

1. **Workflow Schema Generation**:
   - Run `python scripts/generate_workflow_schema.py` in your project
   - Review generated `.claude/workflow.json`
   - Customize triad types and enforcement mode

2. **CLI Commands**:
   - Try `/workflows list` to see instances
   - Try `/workflows show <id>` for details
   - Test deviation tracking with skip scenarios

3. **Enforcement Modes**:
   - Test strict mode (blocks deviations)
   - Test recommended mode (warns, requires reason)
   - Test optional mode (logs silently)

4. **Domain Versatility**:
   - Test with non-software workflows (RFP, content, legal, etc.)
   - Verify generic metrics work for your domain
   - Report any domain-specific issues

5. **Concurrent Operations**:
   - Create multiple workflow instances
   - Test simultaneous updates
   - Verify file locking prevents corruption

### Feedback Requested

- Does workflow enforcement help or hinder your workflow?
- Are the three enforcement modes appropriate?
- Does the CLI provide enough visibility?
- Any missing features for your use case?

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Auto-Router System**: Intelligent triad routing with semantic similarity and LLM fallback
  - Semantic routing using sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) for fast intent detection
  - LLM disambiguation via Claude API for ambiguous prompts when semantic confidence is low
  - Grace period mechanism (5 turns OR 8 minutes) prevents disruptive mid-conversation re-routing
  - 4-stage graceful degradation: Grace Period ‚Üí Semantic ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí Manual fallback
  - Training mode with confirmation prompts to help new users understand routing behavior
  - CLI commands for debugging and control:
    - `/router-status` - View current routing state and configuration
    - `/switch-triad` - Manually override automatic routing
    - `/router-reset` - Clear routing state and restart
    - `/router-training` - Toggle training mode on/off
    - `/router-stats` - View routing performance metrics

### Improved

- **Code Quality**: Refactored router implementation for maintainability
  - Code health score improved: 8.3/10 ‚Üí 9.1/10
  - Consolidated timestamp generation into `timestamp_utils.py` (eliminated 7 duplicate implementations)
  - Consolidated path construction into `router_paths.py` (eliminated 5 duplicate implementations)
  - Reduced code duplication by 83% in core router utilities
  - Added 16 new utility tests for consolidated functions
  - All refactoring followed safe refactoring rules (no behavior changes)

### Technical Details
