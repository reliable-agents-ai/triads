## [0.7.0-alpha.3] - 2025-10-19

### Changed
- **BREAKING: Confidence-Based Immediate Learning** - Redesigned experience-based learning to work like human learning
  - Removed manual approval workflow (`/knowledge-promote`, `/knowledge-review-drafts` deprecated)
  - Lessons now activate immediately based on confidence scores (≥ 0.70 threshold)
  - Bayesian updating refines confidence based on outcomes (success, failure, contradiction, confirmation)
  - Auto-deprecation when confidence drops below 0.30
  - System learns in real-time from experience, no manual intervention required

### Added
- **Confidence Calculation System** (`src/triads/km/confidence.py`)
  - Evidence-based initial confidence scoring (user_correction: 95%, repeated_mistake: 80%, agent_inference: 65%)
  - Bayesian confidence updates: success +15%, confirmation +20%, failure -40%, contradiction -60%
  - Automatic deprecation when confidence < 0.30 or after 3+ contradictions
  - Status assignment based on confidence thresholds (active, needs_validation, deprecated)

- **CLI Commands for Manual Intervention** (3 new commands)
  - `/knowledge-validate <lesson>` - Manually validate uncertain lesson (+20% confidence boost)
  - `/knowledge-contradict <lesson> [reason]` - Mark lesson as incorrect (-60% confidence)
  - `/knowledge-review-uncertain [triad]` - Review all lessons with confidence < 0.70

- **Automatic Outcome Detection** (`src/triads/km/experience_tracker.py`)
  - Pattern-based conversation analysis detects lesson outcomes automatically
  - Tracks lesson injections in `.claude/experience_state.json`
  - Updates confidence scores on session stop based on detected outcomes
  - 21/21 tests passing with 97% code coverage

- **Hook Enhancements**
  - SessionStart: Shows calibration warnings for uncertain lessons (confidence < 0.70)
  - PreToolUse: Records injections for outcome tracking
  - Stop: Detects outcomes and updates confidence scores automatically

### Fixed
- Query engine now filters out deprecated lessons (`deprecated: true`)
- Confidence weighting applied to relevance scores (final_score = priority_score × confidence)
- Fuzzy label search in CLI commands (supports partial matching)
- **Hook Integration Bugs**:
  - Fixed `update_confidence()` being called with wrong number of parameters (removed `strength` parameter)
  - Fixed outcome name mismatch ('validation' → 'confirmation')
  - Removed all `status: "draft"` references from lesson extraction
  - Updated lesson summary to show uncertain lessons (confidence < 70%) instead of drafts
  - Fixed plugin deployment: `/plugin` command doesn't update hook files, must manually copy or use installation script

### Testing
- 332/332 tests passing (100% pass rate)
- 100% coverage on `confidence.py` module
- 93% coverage on `commands.py` module
- 97% coverage on `experience_tracker.py` module
- 91% coverage on `experience_query.py` module

- Updated `.claude/commands/knowledge-contradict.md` with contradiction workflow
- Added `.claude/commands/knowledge-review-uncertain.md` for reviewing uncertain lessons
- Comprehensive inline documentation with examples

### Migration Notes
- **No migration required**: The draft-based workflow was never fully implemented in production
- Legacy commands `/knowledge-promote`, `/knowledge-review-drafts`, and `/knowledge-archive` mentioned in v0.7.0-alpha.2 are now deprecated
- New workflow: Lessons learn immediately based on confidence scores (≥ 0.70 threshold)
- Use `/knowledge-review-uncertain` to see all uncertain lessons (confidence < 0.70)
- Use `/knowledge-validate` and `/knowledge-contradict` for manual intervention when needed

### Deprecated

- `/knowledge-promote` command (planned but not implemented)
- `/knowledge-review-drafts` command (planned but not implemented)
- `/knowledge-archive` command (planned but not implemented)

## [0.7.0-alpha.1] - 2025-10-17

### Added

- **Workflow Enforcement System** - Generic, schema-driven workflow enforcement for ANY workflow type
  - **Core Modules** (8 modules, 2,365 lines production code):
    - `schema_loader.py` - Load workflow.json with validation and query interface
    - `instance_manager.py` - Manage individual workflow instances with file locking
    - `triad_discovery.py` - Dynamically discover triads from `.claude/agents/` directory
    - `metrics/` - Pluggable metrics framework with CodeMetricsProvider (git-based)
    - `validator.py` - Schema-driven validation (no hardcoded triad names)
    - `enforcement.py` - Three-mode enforcement engine (strict/recommended/optional)
    - `cli.py` - User-facing CLI functions for workflow management
    - `git_utils.py` - Unified git command execution with consistent error handling

  - **CLI Commands** via `/workflows`:
    - `/workflows list [--status STATUS]` - List all instances with filtering and pagination
    - `/workflows show <instance-id>` - Display detailed instance information
    - `/workflows resume <instance-id>` - Get workflow resume guidance with next step suggestions
    - `/workflows history <instance-id>` - Show deviation history and chronological analytics
    - `/workflows abandon <instance-id> --reason "..."` - Mark instance as abandoned with tracking
    - `/workflows analyze` - Cross-instance deviation pattern analysis with recommendations

  - **Generator Script** - Auto-generate workflow.json from existing agents
    - Intelligent triad type inference (research/planning/execution/quality/release)
    - Sensible defaults for new workflows
    - Customization guidance and examples
    - CLI interface: `python scripts/generate_workflow_schema.py`

  - **Three Enforcement Modes**:
    - **Strict Mode**: Hard blocks deviations, requires emergency override with justification
    - **Recommended Mode** (DEFAULT): Warns about deviations, allows skip with documented reason
    - **Optional Mode**: Logs deviations silently, minimal friction for experimental work

  - **Instance-Based Architecture**:
    - Individual JSON files per workflow instance (`.claude/workflows/instances/`)
    - Complete workflow history and deviation tracking
    - Concurrent-safe operations with fcntl file locking
    - Lifecycle: instances/ → completed/ or abandoned/

  - **Domain-Agnostic Design**:
    - Works with software development, RFP writing, content creation, legal documents, etc.
    - Generic metrics: "content created" not "lines of code"
    - Configurable significance thresholds per domain
    - Schema-driven rules, no hardcoded workflow assumptions

### Improved

- **Code Quality** (Garden Tending Phase 1 & 2):
  - Consolidated git command execution into `git_utils.py` (~70 lines duplication removed)
  - Refactored `audit.py`, `code_metrics.py` to use unified GitRunner
  - Extracted path constants for consistency and maintainability
  - Added comprehensive input validation across CLI functions
  - Added warnings for type inference defaults
  - Added pagination support for large workflow lists

- **Legacy Deprecation**:
  - Deprecated `validator.py` (hardcoded) in favor of `validator_new.py` (generic)
  - Deprecated `enforcement.py` (single mode) in favor of `enforcement_new.py` (three modes)
  - Created migration guide: `docs/MIGRATION_v1.0.md`
  - Deprecation warnings added with stacklevel for clarity

### Security

- **Multi-Layer Validation**:
  - Path traversal prevention (no `../` in instance IDs or file paths)
  - Command injection prevention (git commands use list args, not shell=True)
  - Timeout protection on all subprocess calls (30s default)
  - Input validation (alphanumeric + hyphens only for instance IDs)
  - File locking prevents race conditions in concurrent operations

- **30+ Security Tests**:
  - Path traversal attacks blocked
  - Command injection attempts prevented
  - Race condition mitigation validated
  - Timeout enforcement verified

### Technical Details

- **Test Coverage**: 488 tests passing, 95% average coverage
  - Workflow enforcement: 95% coverage
  - CLI module: 93% coverage
  - Zero regressions from refactoring
- **Performance**: Fast operations (<50ms for most, <2s for git metrics)
- **Backward Compatible**: Legacy modules still work (with deprecation warnings)
- **Zero New Dependencies**: Uses Python standard library + existing dependencies

### What to Test (Alpha Testers)

1. **Workflow Schema Generation**:
   - Run `python scripts/generate_workflow_schema.py` in your project
   - Review generated `.claude/workflow.json`
   - Customize triad types and enforcement mode

2. **CLI Commands**:
   - Try `/workflows list` to see instances
   - Try `/workflows show <id>` for details
   - Test deviation tracking with skip scenarios

3. **Enforcement Modes**:
   - Test strict mode (blocks deviations)
   - Test recommended mode (warns, requires reason)
   - Test optional mode (logs silently)

4. **Domain Versatility**:
   - Test with non-software workflows (RFP, content, legal, etc.)
   - Verify generic metrics work for your domain
   - Report any domain-specific issues

5. **Concurrent Operations**:
   - Create multiple workflow instances
   - Test simultaneous updates
   - Verify file locking prevents corruption
