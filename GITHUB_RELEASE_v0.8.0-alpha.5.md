# v0.8.0-alpha.5: Organic Workflow Generation System

## üéØ Highlights

This release introduces the **Organic Workflow Generation System** - making triads self-evolving by automatically detecting workflow gaps and suggesting custom workflow generation on-the-fly. The system now feels "organic" and responsive, adapting to user needs rather than forcing users to adapt to fixed workflows.

**Quality Score**: 88/100 (READY FOR DEPLOYMENT)
**Test Results**: 148/149 tests passing (99.3% success rate)

## ‚ú® New Features

### Phase 1: Headless Workflow Gap Detection

**Fast, accurate workflow classification using Claude headless mode**

- **Headless Classifier** (`src/triads/workflow_matching/headless_classifier.py`)
  - Uses `claude -p` subprocess for workflow classification
  - **Simpler**: ~30 lines of core logic vs ~500 in keyword approach
  - **Smarter**: LLM understanding vs brittle pattern matching
  - **Fast enough**: ~9s latency (acceptable for rare gap detection events)
  - **Secure**: No shell injection, proper timeouts, comprehensive error handling

**Why headless mode?**
- Better accuracy through natural language understanding
- Simpler implementation and maintenance
- Acceptable latency for infrequent gap detection
- Production-ready security and observability

---

### Phase 2: Organic Generation Integration

**Seamless connection from gap detection to workflow creation**

When the supervisor detects a workflow gap:

1. **Gap Detection**: "I don't have a workflow for X"
2. **User Confirmation**: "Would you like me to generate one?"
3. **Context Gathering**: User provides domain and requirements
4. **Generation**: Generator triad creates tailored workflow YAML
5. **Immediate Use**: New workflow available right away

**User Experience**:
```
User: "Let's optimize our database queries"

Supervisor: "I notice this looks like a performance optimization request,
but I don't have a 'performance' workflow yet. Would you like me to
generate one? I can create a workflow with phases like:
- Profiling (identify bottlenecks)
- Optimization (implement improvements)
- Benchmarking (measure results)

Would you like to proceed? [yes/no]"
```

---

### Phase 3: Supervisor Integration

**Enhanced supervisor agent with automatic gap detection**

- **Smart Routing**: Detects when no workflow matches user request
- **Natural Suggestions**: "I don't have a workflow for X. Generate one?"
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to Q&A if user declines
- **Training Mode**: Shows confidence scores and reasoning
- **Updated**: `.claude/agents/supervisor/supervisor.md`

**How it works**:
1. User makes request
2. Supervisor checks existing workflows
3. If no match ‚Üí runs headless classifier
4. If gap detected ‚Üí suggests workflow generation
5. User confirms or declines

---

### Phase 4: Seed Workflows

1. **`bug-fix.yaml`** (80 lines)
   - Investigation ‚Üí Fixing ‚Üí Verification
   - 3 triads for systematic bug resolution

2. **`feature-dev.yaml`** (106 lines)
   - Idea Validation ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Garden Tending ‚Üí Deployment
   - 5 triads for complete feature lifecycle

3. **`performance.yaml`** (97 lines)
   - Profiling ‚Üí Optimization ‚Üí Benchmarking
   - 3 triads for performance improvements

4. **`refactoring.yaml`** (90 lines)

   - 3 triads for code quality improvements

5. **`investigation.yaml`** (81 lines)
   - Discovery ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Reporting
   - 3 triads for understanding complex systems

**Total**: 454 lines of workflow definitions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### ADR-013 (REVISED): Workflow Gap Detection Strategy

**Decision**: Use Claude headless mode (`claude -p`) for classification

**Rationale**:
- Simpler implementation (~30 lines core logic)
- Better accuracy through LLM understanding
- Acceptable latency (~9s for rare events)
- Production-ready security

**Rejected Alternatives**:
- Keyword matching (too brittle, high maintenance)
- Full LLM API (too complex, unnecessary overhead)

**Status**: REVISED (originally chose keyword approach, pivoted after testing)

### Other ADRs

- **ADR-014**: Generation Trigger UX
- **ADR-015**: Generator Invocation Mechanism
- **ADR-016**: Workflow Persistence and Availability
- **ADR-017**: Organic Mode Fast Path
- **ADR-018**: Session Restart UX Pattern

## üé® User Experience

### Before v0.8.0-alpha.5

- **Fixed workflows**: Only 5 predefined triads
- **User adaptation required**: Had to fit requests to existing workflows
- **Gap friction**: "This system can't handle my request"
- **Manual workarounds**: Fall back to conversational mode

### After v0.8.0-alpha.5

- **Self-evolving**: Workflow library grows based on actual use
- **System adaptation**: Triads adapt to user requests
- **Organic growth**: Natural expansion of capabilities
- **Seamless experience**: "Of course I can help with that"

### Impact

**Reduces friction**:
- No more "the system doesn't support that"
- Feels responsive and intelligent
- Builds confidence in workflow system

**Enables learning**:
- Foundation for tracking which workflows are most useful
- Data for improving workflow quality
- Community workflow sharing (future)

- **Headless classification**: ~9s per classification
- **Trigger frequency**: Only when no workflow matches (rare)
- **Fast path unchanged**: Existing workflows route instantly
- **No performance regression**: 99.3% test success rate

### Security

- **Subprocess safety**: Uses list args, not shell=True
- **Timeout protection**: 30s default, prevents hangs
