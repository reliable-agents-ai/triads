# Review Draft Knowledge

You are helping the user review **draft** process knowledge that was automatically learned from conversations.

## Your Task

1. **Search for draft knowledge**: Query all knowledge graphs for nodes with `status: "draft"`
2. **Display each draft** with:
   - Node ID
   - Label
   - Priority (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Process type (checklist, pattern, warning, requirement)
   - Detection method (how it was learned)
   - Content (full checklist/pattern/warning details)
   - Triad where it's stored
   - Created date

3. **Group by priority**: Show CRITICAL first, then HIGH, then MEDIUM, then LOW

4. **For each draft, ask the user**:
   - Is this lesson accurate and useful?
   - Options:
     - ‚úÖ **Promote** (make it active) - Use `/knowledge-promote <node_id>`
     - ‚ùå **Archive** (false positive) - Use `/knowledge-archive <node_id>`
     - ‚è∏Ô∏è  **Keep as draft** (review later) - Do nothing

5. **Show statistics**:
   - Total drafts by priority
   - Breakdown by detection method (user_correction, repeated_mistake, explicit)
   - Breakdown by triad

## Implementation

Use the following approach:

1. **Load all graphs** from `.claude/graphs/`
2. **Filter nodes** where `status == "draft"`
3. **Sort** by priority (CRITICAL ‚Üí HIGH ‚Üí MEDIUM ‚Üí LOW), then by created_at (newest first)
4. **Format output** in a clear, reviewable format

## Example Output

```markdown
# üìã Draft Knowledge Review

**Total drafts**: 5
- CRITICAL: 2
- HIGH: 1
- MEDIUM: 1
- LOW: 1

## Notes

- Draft lessons are created automatically by the experience learning system
- They start as drafts to prevent false positives
- Once promoted, they become active and will appear in PreToolUse hooks
- Archived lessons are marked with `status: "archived"` and won't be shown again
