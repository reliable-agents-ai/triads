# Task 3 Completion Summary

## Overview

Task 3 successfully integrates Steps 6.9 and 6.10 into upgrade-executor.md, completing the workflow automation integration.

## Changes Made

### File Modified: `.claude/agents/system-upgrade/upgrade-executor.md`

**Location**: Between Step 6.8 (Generate Domain-Specific Brief Skills) and Step 7 (Update CLAUDE.md with @imports)

### Step 6.9: Analyze Entry Points

**Objective**: Generate routing decision table from workflow structure.

**Purpose**: Analyzes triads and their purposes to determine which work types should route to which triads, creating a domain-agnostic routing table.

**Command**:
```bash
python triads/entry_point_analyzer.py \
  --settings .claude/settings.json \
  --skills-dir .claude/skills/software-development \
  --output .claude/routing_decision_table.yaml
```

**Key Features**:
- Reads triad configurations from settings.json
- Analyzes triad purpose fields using keyword matching
- Maps work types (bug, feature, refactor, release, documentation) to triads
- Assigns confidence scores (0.70-0.95) based on keyword overlap
- Generates routing decision YAML with routing_decisions, fallback, and ambiguity_resolution sections

**Validation Checkboxes**:
- [ ] Check `.claude/routing_decision_table.yaml` was created
- [ ] File contains `routing_decisions` section with work types
- [ ] Each work type has: target_triad, entry_agent, brief_skill, confidence
- [ ] File contains `fallback` section
- [ ] File contains `ambiguity_resolution` section
- [ ] Confidence scores are between 0.70 and 0.95

**Example Output**: Complete YAML structure showing routing from work types to triads

### Step 6.10: Generate Coordination Skills

**Objective**: Create coordination skills for each brief skill.

**Purpose**: Generates coordination skills that orchestrate complete workflow from user request → brief creation → routing → triad execution.

**Command**:
```bash
python triads/coordination_skill_generator.py \
  --routing-table .claude/routing_decision_table.yaml \
  --output-dir .claude/skills/software-development
```

**Key Features**:
- Reads routing decision table
- Generates one coordination skill per work type
- Uses 4-phase workflow template:
  - Phase 1: CREATE BRIEF
  - Phase 2: ROUTE TO TRIAD
  - Phase 3: INVOKE TRIAD
  - Phase 4: MONITOR EXECUTION
- Includes error handling, examples, and constitutional compliance sections
- Writes skills to `.claude/skills/{domain}/coordinate-{work_type}.md`

**Validation Checkboxes**:
- [ ] One coordination skill generated per work type in routing table
- [ ] Skills placed in `.claude/skills/{domain}/` directory
- [ ] Each skill has filename pattern: `coordinate-{work_type}.md`
- [ ] Each skill has valid frontmatter with name, description, category, domain, allowed_tools
- [ ] Each skill contains 4-phase workflow
- [ ] Each skill contains error handling sections
- [ ] Each skill contains examples
- [ ] Each skill contains constitutional compliance section

**Example Filenames**:
- `.claude/skills/software-development/coordinate-feature.md`
- `.claude/skills/software-development/coordinate-bug.md`
- `.claude/skills/software-development/coordinate-refactor.md`
- `.claude/skills/software-development/coordinate-release.md`

**Example Skill Structure**: Complete coordinate-feature.md template with frontmatter, phases, and sections

## Integration Impact

### Workflow Enhancement

The integration of Steps 6.9 and 6.10 completes the automation chain:

**Before**:
1. Gap analyzer identifies missing components
2. Upgrade executor copies templates manually
3. Brief skills generated with research-backed keywords
4. **MANUAL**: User manually creates routing configuration
5. **MANUAL**: User manually creates coordination skills

**After**:
1. Gap analyzer identifies missing components
2. Upgrade executor copies templates manually
3. Brief skills generated with research-backed keywords
4. **AUTOMATED**: Step 6.9 analyzes workflow and generates routing table
5. **AUTOMATED**: Step 6.10 generates coordination skills from routing table

### Value Delivered

1. **Domain-Agnostic Routing**: Works for any domain (software, design, legal, business, research, content)
2. **Automatic Entry Point Discovery**: Analyzes triad purposes to determine optimal routing
3. **Coordination Automation**: Generates complete workflow orchestration skills
4. **Zero Manual Configuration**: No YAML editing required, all generated from workflow analysis
5. **Constitutional Compliance**: All generated content includes error handling, examples, and compliance sections

The system can now:
- Automatically determine which work type routes to which triad
- Generate coordination skills that manage the complete workflow
- Handle any domain (software, design, legal, business, research, content) without manual configuration
